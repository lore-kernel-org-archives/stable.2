For both of these, we have explained in the past why that is the case.

For the cherry-pick issue, we use quilt for the stable trees because it
can handle adding/moving/deleting things in any order, like is required
here.  Using a git tree does not.  So cherry-pick is not part of our
backport process because it's just not possible.

To make it possible, at each commit we would have to keep a local copy
of the current patches in a git tree, and then generate the new commit
from that, pull it out of that tree, apply it to the quilt tree, and
then go and regenerate the git tree (if needed).  In short, a mess and
would slow us down even more.

So yes, renames for "simple" things are a pain at times, it's just part
of the process.  Luckily Sasha's bot catch them quickly and provide a
backport easily in a day or so, so if you want, just rely on that.

For cc: the mailing list, no, we don't do that as it would make things
SO much noiser, and for some patches, a total mess.  We cc: everyone
involved in the original patch based on the info in the commit itself.
That's a policy decision we aren't going to change at this point in time
and attempting to add it for only one subsystem like you have asked for
here is going to be a mess.

If you care about these types of failures, just set up a lei filter to
catch them as we post these failures in public, that way no additional
mail needs to be sent.

thanks,
