Subject: mm/rmap: fix missing barrier between anon_vma init and vma->anon_vma publish
Date: Sat, 5 Sep 2026 14:18:19 +0800

On arm64 server, we found __anon_vma_prepare() reuses anon_vma and
anon_vma->root is stale due to missing memory barrier, leading to lock and
unlock two different anon_vma->root, thus leading to a anon_vma will never
be unlocked, and another anon_vma couldn't be locked anymore.

The race is as follows:

    THREAD A                             THREAD B
__anon_vma_prepare                __anon_vma_prepare
 anon_vma = anon_vma_alloc();
 // writes may out of order here
 vma->anon_vma = anon_vma;
                                   anon_vma = find_mergeable_anon_vma(vma);
                                   anon_vma_lock_write(anon_vma);
                                     // may still see the old root
                                     down_write(&anon_vma->root->rwsem);
                                   anon_vma_unlock_write(anon_vma);
                                     // see the new root, never unlock old
                                     up_write(&anon_vma->root->rwsem);

thread A triggers page fault and calls __anon_vma_prepare() to prepare
anon_vma for the faulting vma.  __anon_vma_prepare() allocates and
initializes a new anon_vma, and then publishes it to the vma with a plain
store.  anon_vma_prepare() only requires the mmap_lock to be held for
reading, so two threads can fault on adjacent VMAs at the same time. 
While thread A publishes a new anon_vma, thread B could finds the anon_vma
via find_mergeable_anon_vma() and then locks anon_vma->root->rwsem.

However, due to missing barrier, thread B can observe the published
pointer but a stale anon_vma->root because the stores from
anon_vma_alloc() aren't yet visible.  What's the value of the stale
anon_vma->root?  __put_anon_vma() doesn't clear anon_vma->root, so the
root of the new allocated anon_vma may point to a valid anon_vma.

As a result, thread B can call anon_vma_lock_write() with the old root,
and call anon_vma_unlock_write() with the new root, leading to a anon_vma
will never be unlocked, and another anon_vma couldn't be locked anymore
(it's count is dropped from 0 to -1 due to wrong unlock).

To fix it, change the plain store `vma->anon_vma = anon_vma` to store
release, so that the fields of anon_vma are visible before anon_vma is
published to vma->anon_vma.

We don't need a read barrier at read side for thread B.  The load of
anon_vma and anon_vma->root have address-dependency.  According to
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt and some investigations, only Alpha
needs address-dependency barriers and it has been handled by READ_ONCE().

This issue needs two adjacent VMAs aren't merged but are compatible for
anon_vma.  We reproduced this issue in v5.10 with KSM enabled.  The kernel
doesn't merge commit cf7e7a3503df ("mm: prevent KSM from breaking VMA
merging for new VMAs"), so there are many adjacent VMAs that aren't merged
but are compatible for anon_vma.

Without this fix, our production environment could reproduce this issue
about 2-5 times each month.  After adding a smp_mb() before
anon_vma_lock_write(anon_vma) in __anon_vma_prepare(), which is different
to this patch, this issue hasn't be reproduced for one month.
