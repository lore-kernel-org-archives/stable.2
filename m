7.3-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>

commit ad1fd828aa3944efc393b84b0d7c02483f1b5638 upstream.

In the first implementation of the translation table events, it was only
possible to announce:

* ADD: new locally detected client
* DEL: disappeared local client

If an ADD event was queued and then a DEL event was queued in the same
timeslot, it is valid to destroy both events because nothing actually
changed for remode nodes

But with commit 3c4f7ab60cc2 ("batman-adv: improve the TT component to
support runtime flag changes") and subsequent changes, it could also happen
that there are extra ADD events:

* ADD: _NEW_ locally detected client
* ADD: already existing client with new flags
* DEL: disappeared local client

The first and the last type of event could in theory still be removed
together from the (to be announced) events queue. But if the "update flags"
ADD is dropped together with the DEL, it would still leave global
translation table of a remote node in the incorrect state - believing that
the client didn't disappear.

If a detected client was previously announced, a DEL event must only
overwrite the "update flags" ADD but the DEL itself must still continue to
exist in the (to be anounced) events queue. For now, adjustment of the
announced flags is used for everything instead of dropping already queued
up events completely.

Similarly, a DEL followed by an ADD caused both entries to be deleted. But
the new ADD could announce flags changes which were not yet present for the
client before it was marked for DELetion. The new ADD must therefore only
overwrite the DEL - but still be kept.
