6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>

commit 476ef286a7a5db8bda51325dc0c45887b4d99d9a upstream.

__umount_mnt() resets ->overmount of the parent when it unmounts the
mount that overmounts it. mnt_change_mountpoint() doesn't. It moves the
mount to its new parent and leaves the old one pointing at it.

For a mount that is moved beneath in attach_recursive_mnt() that doesn't
matter. The new mount has already reset ->overmount of the old parent by
the time the old top mount is moved onto it.

It matters for reparent() though. propagate_umount() moves a surviving
overmount onto the first ancestor that isn't going to be unmounted. The
mount it was taken from is unmounted immediately afterwards. If a file
descriptor keeps that unmounted mount alive ->overmount points at the
moved mount. That's a dangling pointer and UAF as the moved mount is
unmounted and freed.

do_lock_mount() follows ->overmount from the target path under
mount_lock. With a file descriptor on such a mount as the target of a
mount beneath topmost_overmount() walks into the freed mount and
do_lock_mount() takes references on whatever it finds there.

So reset ->overmount of the old parent in mnt_change_mountpoint() the
same way __umount_mnt() does. A mount's ->overmount is then always a
mount that is attached to it.

Fixes: ffdc52fbbd58 ("prevent mount hash conflicts")
