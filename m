The patch titled
     Subject: zram: fix out-of-bounds access in read_block_state()
has been added to the -mm mm-new branch.  Its filename is
     zram-fix-out-of-bounds-access-in-read_block_state.patch

This patch will shortly appear at
     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/25-new.git/tree/patches/zram-fix-out-of-bounds-access-in-read_block_state.patch

This patch will later appear in the mm-new branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Note, mm-new is a provisional staging ground for work-in-progress
patches, and acceptance into mm-new is a notification for others take
notice and to finish up reviews.  Please do not hesitate to respond to
review feedback and post updated versions to replace or incrementally
fixup patches in mm-new.

The mm-new branch of mm.git is not included in linux-next

If a few days of testing in mm-new is successful, the patch will me moved
into mm.git's mm-unstable branch, which is included in linux-next

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/process/submit-checklist.rst when testing your code ***

The -mm tree is included into linux-next via various
branches at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm
and is updated there most days

read_block_state() calculates nr_pages before taking dev_lock.  If the
device is reset and reinitialized with a smaller disksize before lock
acquisition, nr_pages still describes the old table.  The subsequent loop
can then call slot_lock() past the end of the newly allocated table.

Read disksize after acquiring dev_lock and checking that the device is
initialized.  The read lock then keeps the table and its bound stable for
the duration of the scan.
