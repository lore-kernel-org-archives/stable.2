The patch titled
     Subject: mm: memcontrol: raise MEMCG_MAX for charges that fail without reclaiming
has been added to the -mm mm-new branch.  Its filename is
     mm-memcontrol-raise-memcg_max-for-charges-that-fail-without-reclaiming.patch

This patch will shortly appear at
     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/25-new.git/tree/patches/mm-memcontrol-raise-memcg_max-for-charges-that-fail-without-reclaiming.patch

This patch will later appear in the mm-new branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Note, mm-new is a provisional staging ground for work-in-progress
patches, and acceptance into mm-new is a notification for others take
notice and to finish up reviews.  Please do not hesitate to respond to
review feedback and post updated versions to replace or incrementally
fixup patches in mm-new.

The mm-new branch of mm.git is not included in linux-next

If a few days of testing in mm-new is successful, the patch will me moved
into mm.git's mm-unstable branch, which is included in linux-next

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/process/submit-checklist.rst when testing your code ***

The -mm tree is included into linux-next via various
branches at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm
and is updated there most days

Subject: mm: memcontrol: raise MEMCG_MAX for charges that fail without reclaiming
Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2026 10:48:35 -0700

Charges that exceed memory.max and return through the nomem label can
raise no event and simply return -ENOMEM.

A non-blocking charge can hit the limit, get rejected, but is not visible
in memory.events.

This was noticed in a production setting where bpf_mem_alloc() attempted
to refill its per-cpu freelists, which triggered a non-blocking charge
while at the limit.

Commit d6e103a757fa ("mm: memcontrol: do not miss MEMCG_MAX events for
enforced allocations") added raised_max_event to cover charges that are
force charged without ever reaching reclaim, but charges that are rejected
outright were left out.  Getting an allocation failure without the
corresponding MEMCG_MAX event is unexpected and makes debugging and
monitoring harder.

Raise the event on the way out for rejected charges as well, by routing
the -ENOMEM return through the same exit path that already covers forced
charges.  The existing behavior of raising a MEMCG_MAX event on every
charge/reclaim/retry iteration is left unchanged.

Tested with a module that performs accounted GFP_NOWAIT page allocations
from a task in a cgroup at its memory.max, and measures the resulting
memory.events:max delta.  Without this patch the rejected charges raise no
event at all; with it the delta matches the number of rejected charges
exactly.  A GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_NORETRY control, which reaches reclaim,
raises the same two events per failed charge before and after, confirming
the existing charge/reclaim/retry accounting is unchanged.
