[ Upstream commit f7c0366e0a80bf8cd5eacc5479927abb50958b5e ]

The copychunk error mapping handles -EACCES in an independent if
statement. The following error chain therefore reaches its final else
clause and overwrites STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED with
STATUS_UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR.

Join the -EACCES check to the remaining error chain so an access failure
is returned as STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

I have the full picture: the one-line `if`/`else if` bug is in this
6.12.111 tree, it applies cleanly, and the original submitter explicitly
asked for stable. Writing up the nine-phase analysis.

===============================================================
PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS
===============================================================

**Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE**

Record: **[ksmbd]** **[preserve]** preserve access denied status for
copychunk.

Subsystem is the in-kernel SMB3 server. “Preserve” here means “stop
overwriting a correctly computed NTSTATUS,” which is a correctness fix,
not a feature.

**Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS**

Mainline commit `f7c0366e0a80bf8cd5eacc5479927abb50958b5e` (author
Namjae Jeon, AuthorDate 2026-07-07, CommitDate 2026-08-17):

- Signed-off-by: Namjae Jeon \<linkinjeon@kernel.org\> (ksmbd
  maintainer; he both authored and committed it)
- No Fixes:, Reported-by, Tested-by, Reviewed-by, Acked-by, Link:, or
  Cc: stable on the committed version

The absence of Fixes:/Cc: stable on the committed object is expected for
this review pipeline and is not a negative signal.

An independent mailing-list submission of the **same one-line change**
did carry those tags (see Phase 4):
- Fixes: e2f34481b24d ("cifsd: add server-side procedures for SMB3")
- Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org
- Reviewed-by: ChenXiaoSong

**Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT**

Record:
- **Bug:** In `fsctl_copychunk()`, `-EACCES` is handled by a standalone
  `if`. The next `if (ret == -EAGAIN) / else if ... / else` chain then
  runs anyway.
- **Symptom:** `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` is written, then immediately
  overwritten by `STATUS_UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR`.
- **Failure mode:** SMB clients doing server-side copy (FSCTL_COPYCHUNK
  / FSCTL_COPYCHUNK_WRITE) see a generic I/O error instead of access
  denied. The copy is still rejected; the protocol status is wrong.
- **Version info:** none in the committed message. The UnionTech
  submission pins it to the original cifsd SMB3 engine commit.
- **Root cause:** missing `else` so `-EACCES` falls into the final
  `else`.

**Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES**

Record: Not hidden. The message describes a real control-flow bug.
“Preserve” is the action verb for keeping the correct status.

===============================================================
PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS - LINE BY LINE
===============================================================

**Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES**

Record:
- File: `fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c` — 1 line changed (`if` → `else if`)
- Function: `fsctl_copychunk()`
- Scope: single-file surgical fix

**Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE**

This tree currently has:

```7988:8005:fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c
        if (ret < 0) {
                if (ret == -EACCES)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
                if (ret == -EAGAIN)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_FILE_LOCK_CONFLICT;
                else if (ret == -EBADF)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE;
                else if (ret == -EFBIG || ret == -ENOSPC)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_DISK_FULL;
                else if (ret == -EINVAL)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
                else if (ret == -EISDIR)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_FILE_IS_A_DIRECTORY;
                else if (ret == -E2BIG)
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_INVALID_VIEW_SIZE;
                else
                        rsp->hdr.Status = STATUS_UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR;
        }
```

Record: Before, `-EACCES` sets `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`, then misses
`-EAGAIN` and every later `else if`, and the final `else` overwrites it
with `STATUS_UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR`. After, `-EACCES` is exclusive and the
status sticks. Other errno mappings are unchanged. This is the
`ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges()` error path, not probe/init.

**Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM**

Record: **Logic / correctness.** Missing `else` on an errno-to-NTSTATUS
ladder. `-EACCES` is a real return from `ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges()`:

```1840:1847:fs/smb/server/vfs.c
        if (!(src_fp->daccess & (FILE_READ_DATA_LE | FILE_EXECUTE_LE)))
{
                pr_err("no right to read(%pD)\n", src_fp->filp);
                return -EACCES;
        }
        if (!(dst_fp->daccess & (FILE_WRITE_DATA_LE |
FILE_APPEND_DATA_LE))) {
                pr_err("no right to write(%pD)\n", dst_fp->filp);
                return -EACCES;
        }
```

`vfs_copy_file_range()` can also return `-EACCES`. The access check
still denies the copy; only the SMB status is wrong.

**Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY**

Record: Obviously correct. One token. No API, locking, or allocation
change. Regression risk is negligible: `-EACCES` already matched nothing
else in the chain.

===============================================================
PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION
===============================================================

**Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES**

Record: `git blame -L 7988,8005 fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c` attributes the
whole ladder to `e2f34481b24db2` (“cifsd: add server-side procedures for
SMB3”, Namjae Jeon, 2021-03-16). That is the original ksmbd/cifsd SMB3
engine, present since the server was merged (v5.15-era). The bug is old,
not recent churn.

**Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG**

Committed object has no Fixes: tag. The equivalent linux-cifs patch
tagged `e2f34481b24d`. `git merge-base --is-ancestor e2f34481b24db2
HEAD` succeeded — the introducing commit is in this tree. No later
rewrite of this ladder was found in this checkout.

**Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES**

Record: Recent `smb2pdu.c` work in this tree is unrelated (partial
QUERY_INFO responses, compound errors, lease/durable-handle fixes).
Neighboring mainline copychunk work from the same day (`fd309860ef245`
overlapping-copy data preservation, `8482150a0743c` ADS copychunk) is
**not** in HEAD and is **not** required: this change only joins two
`if`s in the error map. Standalone.

**Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS**

Record: Namjae Jeon is the ksmbd maintainer (`git log --author="Namjae
Jeon" -- fs/smb/server/`). He authored and committed this. Same-day
mainline commits touch other copychunk behavior but do not alter this
mapping.

**Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS**

Record: None. `git show f7c0366e0a80b | git apply --check` succeeded on
this tree (hunk offset -764 lines). No new helpers or structs.

===============================================================
PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH
===============================================================

**Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION**

Record:
- `b4 dig -c f7c0366e0a80b` failed (lore returned an error to b4).
- Direct lore search found the same fix submitted independently:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-
cifs/2DC5EE1DC892643F+20260731072020.1307022-1-raoxu@uniontech.com/

Xu Rao (UnionTech), 2026-07-31, subject “ksmbd: preserve
STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED for copychunk errors”. Same `if` → `else if`. Cites
**MS-SMB2 3.3.5.15.6**: FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK / COPYCHUNK_WRITE must fail
with `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` when the source open lacks `FILE_READ_DATA`
or the destination lacks `FILE_WRITE_DATA`/`FILE_APPEND_DATA`.
**Fixes:** e2f34481b24d. **Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org.** No NAK.

Namjae’s committed patch (author date 2026-07-07) is the same change,
queued earlier in ksmbd-for-next and merged via `ksmbd-for-7.3-rc1`
(`git describe --contains` → `v7.3-rc1~77^2~124`).

**Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH**

Record: UnionTech patch To/Cc: Namjae Jeon, Steve French, Sergey
Senozhatsky, Tom Talpey, linux-cifs, LKML, **stable@vger.kernel.org**.
ChenXiaoSong replied with Reviewed-by.

**Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT**

Record: No syzbot/bugzilla. Two independent authors (maintainer +
UnionTech) found the same missing-`else`. Spec citation is MS-SMB2
3.3.5.15.6.

**Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES**

Record: Not a numbered series. Same-day copychunk patches are
independent and not in this tree; this line does not need them.

**Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY**

Record: lore.kernel.org/stable search for this subject did not turn up a
prior rejection. The UnionTech mail itself was Cced to stable.
ChenXiaoSong noted the bug was already fixed in ksmbd-for-next-next (htt
ps://github.com/smfrench/smb3-
kernel/commit/35e11e324a2f97d2974ef08d308063c9c5f9e9d8) — that is the
maintainer tree copy of this same fix, not a reason to skip stable.

===============================================================
PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
===============================================================

**Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS IN THE DIFF**

Record: `fsctl_copychunk()` only.

**Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS**

Record: Only caller is `smb2_ioctl()` for `FSCTL_COPYCHUNK` /
`FSCTL_COPYCHUNK_WRITE` (`fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c` around 8466–8495).
`smb2_ioctl` is registered as `SMB2_IOCTL_HE` in
`fs/smb/server/smb2ops.c`. Reachable from any authenticated SMB2/SMB3
client issuing a copychunk FSCTL (Windows Explorer / CopyFile server-
side copy, robocopy, smbclient, etc.).

Important: `fsctl_copychunk()`’s return value is discarded. Status is
taken from `rsp->hdr.Status`, then `ksmbd_iov_pin_rsp()` sends the ioctl
response. The wrong status is what the client actually receives.

Tree-not-writable uses `ret = -EACCES; goto out;` in `smb2_ioctl()` and
maps correctly. The broken path is the **file-handle** access check
inside `ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges()`.

**Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES**

Record: `ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges()` → access checks, lock checks,
`vfs_copy_file_range()`. `-EACCES` comes from the access checks (and
potentially VFS).

**Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN**

Record: SMB2 IOCTL (network) → `smb2_ioctl` → `fsctl_copychunk` →
`ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges`. Triggerable by a logged-in SMB user with
opens that lack read-on-source or write-on-dest. Not a local
unprivileged syscall, but a normal file-server path.

**Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS**

Record: The only other `if (ret == -EACCES)` in
`fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c` is the outer `smb2_ioctl()` mapper, which
**already** uses `else if`. This copychunk ladder is the broken
instance.

===============================================================
PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE
===============================================================

**Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?**

Record: Yes. `git describe HEAD` = `p-6.12-3-gc504cf0baa3d8`; `make
kernelversion` = **6.12.111**. Buggy ladder is at
`fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c:7988-8005`. `git merge-base --is-ancestor
f7c0366e0a80b HEAD` failed — fix is **not** in this checkout. Introduced
by `e2f34481b24d` (2021), which **is** an ancestor of HEAD.

**Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS**

Record: **Clean apply.** `git apply --check` of the mainline diff
succeeded (offset -764). Surrounding copychunk ioctl code matches aside
from line numbers. Mainline context uses `FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK` in a
nearby (unchanged) check; this tree still uses `FSCTL_COPYCHUNK`. That
is outside the changed line and did not block apply.

**Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE**

Record: `git log --grep="preserve access denied" -- fs/smb/server` has
no hit. No alternate mapping fix in this tree.

===============================================================
PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT
===============================================================

**Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY**

Record: `fs/smb/server` (ksmbd), `CONFIG_SMB_SERVER`. **IMPORTANT** for
NAS/embedded/distros that ship ksmbd; not core mm/VFS for every box.
Protocol status on copychunk is user-visible for those servers.

**Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY**

Record: Actively maintained (many recent ksmbd commits on this branch).
This particular ladder has been unchanged since 2021.

===============================================================
PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================

**Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED**

Record: Config-specific / server-specific: ksmbd users. Windows and
other SMB clients using server-side copy against ksmbd.

**Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS**

Record: Authenticated client issues FSCTL_COPYCHUNK[_WRITE] with a
source handle lacking read/execute or a dest handle lacking write/append
(or VFS returns `-EACCES`). Common for copy-offload when opens don’t
carry the rights MS-SMB2 requires. Not a rare race.

**Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY**

Record: Wrong NTSTATUS (`STATUS_UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR` instead of
`STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`). Copy is still denied — not a bypass, crash, or
corruption. Clients/apps can surface “I/O device error”, retry, or
mishandle a permission failure. **Severity: MEDIUM**, but it is a
documented SMB protocol violation (MS-SMB2 3.3.5.15.6).

**Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO**

Record:
- **Benefit:** Correct access-denied reporting on a standard Windows
  copy-offload path; matches spec.
- **Risk:** Very low (one `else`, no behavioral change except the status
  for `-EACCES`).
- **Ratio:** Favorable. Independent submitter Cced stable for this exact
  change.

===============================================================
PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS
===============================================================

**Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE**

FOR:
- Real, verified missing-`else` bug in this 6.12.111 tree
- `-EACCES` is a live return from `ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges()`
- Client-visible SMB status is wrong; MS-SMB2 requires ACCESS_DENIED
- 1-line, obviously correct, applies cleanly
- Present since original cifsd merge; introducing commit is in HEAD
- Maintainer-authored; independently rediscovered; Reviewed-by
  ChenXiaoSong; **Cc: stable** on the public patch
- No prerequisites

AGAINST:
- Not a crash, UAF, deadlock, or data-corruption fix
- Committed object dropped Fixes:/Cc: stable
- Only affects `CONFIG_SMB_SERVER`

UNRESOLVED:
- `b4 dig` could not match Namjae’s committed subject (lore error). The
  UnionTech thread was recovered by direct lore search and is the same
  diff.

**Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST**

1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — control flow is unambiguous;
   maintainer committed it; Reviewed-by on the twin patch.
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — wrong NTSTATUS on
   copychunk permission failure.
3. Important issue? **PASS** (medium, protocol) — spec-mandated
   ACCESS_DENIED becomes UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR on a common Windows copy
   path; not a crash, but user-visible interoperability.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — 1 line, one function.
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — `git apply --check`
   succeeded.

**Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES**

Record: None (not a device ID/quirk/DT/build/docs exception). Qualifies
as a normal small correctness fix.

**Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION**

This belongs in 6.12.y. The buggy ladder is here, the fix is one `else`,
and it restores the NTSTATUS ksmbd already tried to set and that MS-SMB2
requires. Risk is essentially zero.

------------------------------------------------
What the commit solves for this tree
------------------------------------------------

On 6.12.111 ksmbd, `fsctl_copychunk()` maps `-EACCES` from
`ksmbd_vfs_copy_file_ranges()` to `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`, then the next
if/else chain overwrites it with `STATUS_UNEXPECTED_IO_ERROR`. SMB
clients doing server-side copy therefore see a generic I/O error instead
of access denied. The copy is still rejected; the protocol status is
wrong. Joining the `-EACCES` arm with `else if` is the whole fix.

It meets the stable rules: obviously correct, real user-visible bug,
tiny, no new API, applies cleanly here. Benefit is correct SMB
semantics; regression risk is negligible.

Concerns: not a panic/UAF class bug; ksmbd-only. Those do not outweigh a
one-line protocol-status fix that an independent submitter already
nominated for stable.
