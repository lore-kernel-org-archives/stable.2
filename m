blockgc really should not free them due to the prealloc inode flag.
Do you still see that with your prefix flag setting fix?  If so we
have a deeper problem.

Yeah, I think even when blockgc should not happen a sanity check
for misbehaving clients is a good idea.

It would be great to get these included in pynfs.

Also a little doc on your setup to run pynfs in client mode against
nfsd with block/scsilayout would probably useful.

As soon as we drop the lock, the result might be stale.  So I suspect
we want a CONVERT_ONLY flag to xfs_bmapi_write that makes it refuse
to allocate blocks instead in one atomic operation.
