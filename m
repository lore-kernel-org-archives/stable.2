The XFS side of the pNFS block and SCSI layout fixes, in one series as
Christoph asked [1]. A pNFS client alone can trigger the bugs fixed by
patches 1 and 3 to 6. The race fixed by patch 7 needs a local process
writing to a shared mapping, and patches 8 and 9 change how a
LAYOUTCOMMIT is made stable.

Patch 1 keeps blockgc from freeing the blocks past EOF that a write
layout handed out. Patches 2 to 4 make LAYOUTCOMMIT refuse a range
without blocks instead of allocating blocks for it, and clamp the
committed length before adding it to the offset. Patch 5 limits the
block count that a write layout asks for at once to one extent, so that
the block reservation cannot wrap, and patch 6 clamps the layout range
to the maximum file size. Patch 7 takes the invalidate lock while mapping a
layout.

Patches 8 and 9 make a LAYOUTCOMMIT stable the way fdatasync does,
instead of forcing the log for every one. With patch 9, a LAYOUTCOMMIT
that only overwrites written blocks replies before its timestamps, and
the change attribute that nfsd derives from the ctime, are stable. A
crash before the next log write can take the change attribute back to
its value before the overwrite. nfsd persists the timestamps for
FILE_SYNC writes and for COMMIT, so this is a question for the nfsd side
as much as for XFS; the fixes do not depend on patches 8 and 9.

Patches 5 to 7 come from the ->map_blocks series [2]. Patch 1 of that
series is in for-next as e3c682dd1130. Its patches 4, 5, 7 and 8, which
let ->map_blocks return more than one mapping, are left for the next
cycle [1].

Patches 1 to 6 are marked for stable. Patch 2 needs a backport for 6.9
and older, where xfs_bmapi_write() has no -ENOSR return, and a context
fix in xfs_bmap.h for 6.12; patch 3 needs one for 7.2 and older, which
do not have fs/xfs/xfs_ioend.c, and patch 5 needs MAXEXTLEN in place of
XFS_MAX_BMBT_EXTLEN for 5.15 and older. Patch 4 should not go without
patches 2 and 3, and patch 6 not without patch 5: on their own, the
clamped range reaches code that shuts XFS down.

XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT_ONLY takes bit 12 of the bmapi flags, which
"xfs: add XFS_BMAPI_UNWRITTEN to unmap unwritten extents in
__xfs_bunmapi()" in the fs-verity series [9] also uses. Whichever goes
in second needs to move to bit 13. The name was used before, by a flag
that commit 26b91c728b2d ("xfs: make COW fork unwritten extent
conversions more robust") removed. That flag only skipped the
allocation and went on to map the hole; this one stops before it.

Dave's rolling transaction series [10] rewrites
xfs_iomap_write_direct(), xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() and
xfs_fs_map_blocks(). In its 37/38 the inode update moves into the
allocation transaction and the path that allocates nothing returns
early; the case added by patch 1 would still need its own transaction
there. Whichever series goes in second needs to carry these changes
over.

The pynfs tests for patches 2 to 4, with a README on running pynfs
against a block layout export, were posted as [11].

Tested on nfsd-testing 78c334bc5ae6 with commit e3c682dd1130 and this
series on top, in QEMU guests with KASAN and lockdep, and XFS_DEBUG
where noted: an nvmet-tcp target, the server (nfsd, XFS on the nvmet
namespace, pnfs export) and one client. The client was pynfs, with the
tests of [11], except for fstests, which ran on the Linux NFSv4.2
client. "Without the series" is nfsd-testing with e3c682dd1130. The test
branch has the same changes as this series, apart from one line each
in xfs_file.c and xfs_ioend.c that differ between the two bases. The
runs for patches 5 and 6 and the pynfs and fstests runs over the block
layout were repeated on v4; the others are from v3, which differs only
in patch 5.

 - LAYOUTCOMMITs of a hole, and of a laid-out range followed by a hole
   (BLOCK7, BLOCK8): without the series XFS shut down ("Corruption of
   in-memory data (0x8) detected at xfs_trans_mod_sb"). With it,
   NFS4ERR_IO, nothing allocated and no warning; BLOCK6 to BLOCK10
   passed in 5 runs, and once with XFS_DEBUG. In both, BLOCK3 fails on a
   bug in the test.
 - The wrapped length (BLOCK10): without the series, NFS4ERR_IO with
   "nfsd: non-standard errno: -63" and a WARNING. With patches 1 to 3
   only, NFS4ERR_IO and the laid-out range stays unwritten, also with
   XFS_DEBUG, without a warning or an assertion. With the series, the
   laid-out range from 4 KiB on is converted and the commit fails at the
   hole.
 - Sashiko's case: with a test-only change that has
   xfs_iext_count_extend() log the inode in every transaction, and v2's
   handling of the refusal (cancel), a LAYOUTCOMMIT of a hole shut XFS
   down ("Corruption of in-memory data (0x8) detected at
   xfs_trans_cancel", from xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() in
   xfs_fs_commit_blocks()). With this series on the same change, BLOCK6,
   BLOCK7 and BLOCK10 passed and XFS kept running.
 - RW LAYOUTGETs (patches 5 and 6): for 16 TiB at offset 0 of an empty
   file, XFS shut down without the series. With it, NFS4ERR_NOSPC and
   XFS kept running, as for NFS4_UINT64_MAX bytes and for 100 GiB; each
   left less than 8 GiB of the 32 GiB free, allocated one extent at a
   time.
   One for 16 GiB with a loga_minlength of 16 GiB is granted in three
   extents. A READ LAYOUTGET at offset 0 for NFS4_UINT64_MAX got
   NFS4ERR_IO with "Access to block zero" without the series, and
   NFS4ERR_INVAL without a warning with it, as patch 6 says.
 - Blocks past EOF under a write layout held for 360 s, with small files
   written on the server (patch 1): kept, no warning.
 - fstests generic/075, 091 and 263 over the block layout: 075 fails
   with an fsx size error with and without the series, and all 10330
   LAYOUTCOMMITs returned 0.
 - The server's own XFS, the other callers of
   xfs_iomap_write_unwritten(): O_DIRECT and buffered writes into
   preallocated space were converted as before, also with XFS_DEBUG.
   fdatasync after an overwrite forced the log 0 times in 5 runs, fsync
   5 times, and fdatasync after an extending write 5 times.
 - fstests -g quick on a local XFS (mkfs.xfs defaults from xfsprogs
   6.6.0, 32 GiB TEST and 8 GiB SCRATCH devices, KASAN and lockdep off),
   with and without the series: 1017 tests ran, and the same 5 failed
   either way (generic/453, 454, 563, 794 and xfs/261).
 - W=1 builds of fs/xfs after each patch on XFS for-next ec8f62cc109a:
   no warnings.

Patch 9 was measured in its v2 posting [7] and is unchanged apart from
the call. No test reaches the race of patch 7 or the delalloc case of
XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT_ONLY.

Changes in v4:
- Patch 5: limit the allocation in xfs_fs_map_blocks() to
  XFS_MAX_BMBT_EXTLEN blocks, which is all that xfs_bmapi_write() maps
  in one mapping, instead of refusing a count whose reservation would
  wrap in xfs_iomap_write_direct(), as Christoph [12] and Darrick [6]
  suggested.
  This answers Sashiko's second point on v3 patch 5: no reservation
  holds more than one extent's worth of blocks now. On the first, an
  RW LAYOUTGET for more than the free space gets the extents that fit
  in the reply, or, when fewer than XFS_MAX_BMBT_EXTLEN blocks are
  free before that, still gets NFS4ERR_NOSPC after nfsd has allocated
  them; the message of patch 5 says so. The Linux block layout client
  does not send a LAYOUTGET on OPEN.
- Patch 6: code unchanged; the result of an RW LAYOUTGET to the end of
  the file in its message updated for patch 5.
- Sashiko's point on v3 patch 6, a READ LAYOUTGET at offset 0 for
  NFS4_UINT64_MAX getting NFS4ERR_INVAL because nfsd asks again at the
  maximum file size: not changed here. With the ->map_blocks series [2],
  where nfsd asks once, that LAYOUTGET was granted.
- Reviewed-by from Christoph on patches 1 to 3 and 7 to 9.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261015-xfs-pnfs-batch-v3-0-54fc7b2e467d@samsung.com

Changes in v3 (from the separate postings):
- Patch 1 (v2 [3]): unchanged; Christoph said it looks good.
- Patches 2 and 3 (v2 patch 1 [4]): split the new flag from its user in
  the pNFS code [5]. xfs_bmapi_write() now returns -ENOSR instead of
  -EIO when it maps nothing, and xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() then
  commits the transaction instead of cancelling it:
  xfs_iext_count_extend() may have logged the inode, and cancelling a
  dirty transaction shuts the filesystem down, as Sashiko pointed out on
  v2 [5]. Patch 2 asserts that XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT_ONLY comes with
  XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT.
- Patch 4 (v2 patch 2 [4]): code unchanged; the message now says what
  the wrap does on top of patches 2 and 3.
- Patches 5 and 6 (v1 patches 2 and 3 [2]): code unchanged, one
  sentence of the message of patch 5 fixed.
- Patch 7 (v1 patch 6 [2]): taken without the patches before it in that
  series, and without the sentence about the patch after it.
- Patch 8 (v2 patch 1 [7]): add the datasync and log_flushed arguments
  to xfs_log_force_inode() itself rather than wrapping a new
  __xfs_log_force_inode(), as Christoph suggested [8].
- Patch 9 (v2 patch 2 [7]): calls xfs_log_force_inode() with them.
- Rebased onto XFS for-next ec8f62cc109a.
