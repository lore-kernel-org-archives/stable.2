[ Upstream commit 71ac392d8b5c23c45c66f30eff1c319580ada4da ]

Just like we did in iwlmvm, we also need to clear the mld state when the
firmware was killed because of the device being powered off during
suspend.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

I have enough of the tree, the sibling mvm fix, and the lore series to
judge this on merit. Writing the full phase-by-phase analysis next.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE**

Record: **[iwlwifi/mld] [reset] [clear MLD driver state when firmware is
killed because the device was powered off during suspend]**

- Subsystem: `wifi: iwlwifi: mld`
- Action verb: **reset** (correctness / recovery, not a feature)
- Intent: after firmware recovery from a power-off-during-suspend, wipe
  MLD software state the same way `iwlmvm` already does

**Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS**

Record (from `git show 71ac392d8b5c2`):
- **Fixes:** none (expected for this review pipeline)
- **Reported-by:** none
- **Tested-by:** none
- **Reviewed-by:** none on the commit itself
- **Acked-by:** none
- **Link:** `https://patch.msgid.link/20260714165826.ff1c9e05e0a9.I8df8d
  4a0384065fd2a32cf258339be77084c55bd@changeid`
- **Cc: stable:** none (not a negative signal)
- **Signed-off-by:** Emmanuel Grumbach (author); Miri Korenblit (iwlwifi
  maintainer)
- Ignore pipeline markers: none present on the original commit

Notable: Intel iwlwifi developers; maintainer SOB; no syzbot/user
reports.

**Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT**

Record:
- **Bug:** When firmware is killed because the NIC was powered off in
  suspend, MLD driver state is left as if the firmware were still
  configured.
- **Symptom:** After that resume path, software
  IDs/keys/scan/FTM/internal STAs no longer match a freshly started
  firmware image. Connection/recovery after suspend can fail; later FW
  commands can error or WARN.
- **Version info:** none in the message. Analog is explicit: “Just like
  we did in iwlmvm”.
- **Root cause (author):** `device_powered_off` stopped firmware
  (`iwl_mld_stop_fw`) and cleared `in_d3`, but never ran the existing
  restart cleanup that zeros restart-sensitive state and walks
  vifs/stations.

**Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES**

Record: **Not disguised.** It is a real recovery-path correctness fix.
“Reset the driver state” is the missing counterpart of
`iwl_mld_restart_cleanup()` already used from `iwl_mld_mac80211_start()`
when `in_hw_restart` is set. The mvm sibling (`0a00c3ec2db76`) states
the same problem more clearly: after power-off, firmware must be
reloaded **and reconfigured**.

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS - LINE BY LINE

**Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES**

Record:
- `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mld/mac80211.c`:
  `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup` un-static’d (`static void` → `void`) — **3
  +/− lines net**
- `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mld/mac80211.h`: export prototype;
  copyright year — **+2**
- `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mld/mld.c`: one call
  `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup(mld);` in `iwl_mld_device_powered_off` —
  **+1**
- Totals: **+4 / −2**, three files, one function body unchanged
- Scope: **single-subsystem, surgical**

**Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE**

Hunk 1 (`mac80211.c`): `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup` still does
`iwl_cleanup_mld` → iterate vifs (`iwl_mld_cleanup_vif`) → iterate
stations (`iwl_mld_cleanup_sta`) → `iwl_mld_ftm_restart_cleanup`. Only
linkage changes (now callable from `mld.c`).

Hunk 2 (`mac80211.h`): prototype so `mld.c` can call it. `mld.c` already
includes `mac80211.h`.

Hunk 3 (`mld.c` `iwl_mld_device_powered_off`, `CONFIG_PM_SLEEP`):

**Before:**
```
wiphy_lock
iwl_mld_stop_fw(mld)   // abort waits, stop device, fw_status.running =
false
in_d3 = false
wiphy_unlock
```

**After:** same, plus `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup(mld)` between stop_fw and
clearing `in_d3`.

Path: PCI resume when scratch/MAC grab shows the device was powered off
(`iwl_op_mode_device_powered_off` from `pcie/drv.c`). Not the happy
wowlan-keep-alive path.

**Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM**

Record: **[Logic / correctness — stale driver state after firmware
death]**

Without cleanup, `iwl_mld_mac80211_start` sees `in_d3 == false`, skips
D3 resume, and calls `iwl_mld_start_fw()` **without**
`iwl_mld_restart_cleanup()`. Firmware is empty; driver still holds:
- `zeroed_on_hw_restart` groups (phy, scan, iface, link, sta, txq)
- firmware station IDs / internal STAs
- keys
- FTM initiator request

`iwl_mld_cleanup_vif` frees internal STAs and keys; skipping it on this
path is a leak plus ID mismatch. Category is **incomplete error/recovery
handling**, not a new feature.

**Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY**

Record:
- **Obviously correct:** reuses the function already used on HW restart;
  mvm does the same from `iwl_op_mode_mvm_device_powered_off`
  (`iwl_mvm_restart_cleanup`).
- **Minimal:** one call + un-static.
- **Regression risk low:** already runs under `wiphy_lock` from
  `iwl_mld_mac80211_start`; `device_powered_off` already takes
  `wiphy_lock`. Cleanup is largely idempotent (`CLEANUP_STRUCT` memset,
  `sta_id != IWL_INVALID_STA` guards). FTM abort on a dead NIC during
  resume is appropriate.
- **Redundant** `in_d3 = false` after `iwl_cleanup_mld` also clears it —
  harmless.
- No public API / data-structure change except making an existing helper
  non-static.

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES**

Record:
- Buggy `iwl_mld_device_powered_off` introduced in **`d1e879ec600f9`**
  (`wifi: iwlwifi: add iwlmld sub-driver`, 2025-03-05; that commit’s
  Makefile is **6.14.0-rc4**).
- Merged to this lineage via `c73ebc0dbb6ed` (`iwlwifi-
  next-2025-06-25`).
- Intermediate: `7aeec8c8d63bf` removed `system_pm_mode` assignment;
  still no cleanup.
- `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup` existed as **static** since MLD
  introduction; this commit only exports it.

**Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG**

Record: **No Fixes: tag.** Bug is original MLD `device_powered_off`
(omit cleanup). Target `d1e879ec600f9` **is** an ancestor of this tree
(`git merge-base --is-ancestor`).

**Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES**

Record:
- **`71ac392d8b5c2`** — this fix (in tree)
- **`0a00c3ec2db76`** — mvm analog, same day/author/series (14/15 vs
  15/15)
- **`1c031ac5a39eb`** — later “do not cleanup FW state when device is
  dead”; **different path** (chanctx unassign / NULL link), not a revert
  of this call
- **`c99bc4d4e0ba6`** — cancel wiphy work before free (same series,
  08/15); not a prerequisite for this hunk

Standalone: no other series patch is required for this one-line call.

**Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS**

Record: Emmanuel Grumbach is a long-time Intel iwlwifi developer. Same-
day pair: mvm cleanup + this MLD mirror. Maintainer Miri Korenblit SOB’d
both. Weight: **high**.

**Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS**

Record: Needs `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup`, `iwl_mld_device_powered_off`,
MLD op_mode — all present since MLD add. `mld.c` already `#include
"mac80211.h"`. **Applies standalone** on this tree.

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION**

Record:
- `b4 dig -c 71ac392d8b5c2` → **https://patch.msgid.link/20260714165826.
  ff1c9e05e0a9.I8df8d4a0384065fd2a32cf258339be77084c55bd@changeid**
- **v2**, `[PATCH v2 iwlwifi-next 15/15]`; v2 cover: resend so next
  contains an unrelated compile fix (`too long hcmds`), **not** a
  redesign of this patch
- Cover: “Usual fixed, cleanups and features from our internal tree.”
  This commit listed under Emmanuel’s fixes.
- Saved mbox: **16 messages, all series posts, zero review replies /
  NAKs / Cc: stable**
- lore.kernel.org / patch.msgid.link HTTP fetch: **403** — discussion
  taken from `b4 dig -m` mbox instead

**Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH**

Record (`b4 dig -w`): To/Cc **Johannes Berg**, **linux-
wireless@vger.kernel.org**, Miri Korenblit, Emmanuel Grumbach. No
Reviewed-by on 15/15 (several other series patches have Johannes R-b).
Applied via iwlwifi-next (`905b418df8af2`, 2026-07-23). Maintainer-tree
merge is the review signal.

**Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT**

Record: **No user/syzbot/bugzilla report.** Bug is reasoned from the mvm
gap. Severity from code: stale FW IDs after D3cold/hibernate-style
power-off — WiFi may not come back cleanly.

**Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES**

Record: 15-patch iwlwifi-next dump. **14/15 is the mvm twin**
(independent). This patch does **not** depend on 01–13. Mix of features
and fixes; this hunk is a self-contained fix.

**Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY**

Record: Web search found **other** iwlwifi MLD restart patches in stable
(e.g. “stop TX during firmware restart” for 6.18/7.0). **No hit** for
this subject on stable@. UNVERIFIED: whether anyone already nominated
this exact commit for older -stable.

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS**

Record: `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup` (export), `iwl_mld_device_powered_off`
(call site). Unchanged callees: `iwl_cleanup_mld`,
`iwl_mld_cleanup_vif`, `iwl_mld_cleanup_sta`,
`iwl_mld_ftm_restart_cleanup`.

**Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS**

Record:
- `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup`: `iwl_mld_mac80211_start` (if
  `in_hw_restart`); **now** `iwl_mld_device_powered_off`
- `iwl_mld_device_powered_off`: op_mode `.device_powered_off` →
  `iwl_op_mode_device_powered_off` → **`_iwl_pci_resume`** in
  `pcie/drv.c` when restore or scratch says powered off
- Context: **PM resume**, process context, already holds `wiphy_lock`
- Reachable on Intel WiFi 7 / MLD laptops that D3cold the NIC or
  hibernate

**Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES**

Record: stop_fw (trans stop, abort waits); cleanup zeros restart groups;
frees internal STAs/keys; may call
`ieee80211_remain_on_channel_expired`; FTM reports failure to cfg80211.
Side effects are the intended reset.

**Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN**

Record: **Userspace-reachable** via suspend/resume (and hibernate), not
a syscall bug. Trigger is common on laptops that cut WiFi power.
Unprivileged users typically cannot force PCI D3cold, but they **do**
suspend.

**Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS**

Record: **Exact mvm analog** `0a00c3ec2db76` — same author, same series.
Pattern is systematic (mvm had the cleanup; mld was missed at
introduction).

---

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE

**Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?**

Record:
- Local tree: **`git describe HEAD` = `v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37`**,
  `make kernelversion` = **7.3.0-rc4**
- MLD files present under `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mld/`
- **`git merge-base --is-ancestor 71ac392d8b5c2 HEAD` succeeds** — this
  fix is **already in this checkout**
- Pre-fix body (parent of 71ac392d8b5c2) had `device_powered_off`
  without cleanup; current `mld.c:750` has the call
- Bug introduced with MLD (`d1e879ec600f9`, ~6.14 development / 2025);
  **not** after 7.3 branched

**Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS**

Record: **Clean apply** on this tree (already applied). Context around
`iwl_mld_device_powered_off` matches the candidate diff. No conflicting
refactor.

**Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE**

Record: This fix **is** here. mvm analog **is** here. No earlier
different MLD-powered-off cleanup. Follow-up `1c031ac5a39eb` is
unrelated chanctx/dead-device WARN, not a replacement.

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY**

Record: **iwlwifi MLD** (`CONFIG_IWLMLD`) — Intel Wi-Fi 7 / MLO devices.
**IMPORTANT** (very common laptop NIC), not core mm/VFS. Affects all
IWLMLD users on PM sleep.

**Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY**

Record: **Active** (regular iwlwifi-next pulls). Bug is an original
omission in a still-young op_mode (~1.5 years), not bitrot in abandoned
code.

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED**

Record: **Driver-specific + config-specific:** `CONFIG_IWLWIFI` +
`CONFIG_IWLMLD` + `CONFIG_PM_SLEEP`. Intel BE200/BE201-class Wi-Fi 7.
Population is large for a driver fix.

**Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS**

Record:
- Trigger: resume after the transport decides the device was powered off
  (scratch bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, or failed NIC grab) — **hibernate, D3cold,
  some s2idle**
- Not every suspend (wowlan-alive path skips this)
- Not a userspace exploit path
- Timing: deterministic once the platform cuts power

**Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY**

Record:
- **Failure:** driver/firmware state desync after resume; commands with
  stale IDs; possible internal-STA/key leak; FTM requests left hanging;
  Wi-Fi may not recover without reload
- Not shown as oops/UAF/CVE in the message (UNVERIFIED as crash)
- **Severity: HIGH** for affected hardware (broken Wi-Fi after suspend),
  **not CRITICAL** (no verified panic/corruption)

Stable-rules fit: **“oh, that’s not good”** / hardware resume quirk, not
theoretical.

**Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO**

Record:
- **Benefit: high** for IWLMLD + PM — resume actually reconfigures like
  mvm
- **Risk: very low** — +1 call to existing helper, same lock as start
  path
- **Ratio: strongly favorable**

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE**

**FOR backporting to this 7.3 tree:**
- Real resume bug: firmware stopped, MLD software state not reset
- Same fix already proven in mvm (`0a00c3ec2db76`)
- Tiny, obviously correct; helper already used on HW restart
- Intel Wi-Fi 7 is common; suspend/resume is a user-facing path
- MLD and the buggy function exist in this tree; no extra prereqs
- Maintainer-tree merge; Johannes on Cc
- Matches stable rule of a real bug that bothers people (Wi-Fi
  dead/wrong after power-off suspend)

**AGAINST:**
- No Reported-by / syzbot / stack trace
- Brief commit message
- 15/15 of a mixed “updates” series, not a dedicated stable submission
- No explicit crash/security
- Power-off-during-suspend is not every resume (wowlan-alive OK)

**UNRESOLVED:**
- Exact user-visible rate (no public bugzilla)
- lore HTTP 403; no on-list NAK found in mbox
- No stable@ discussion of this exact subject

**Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST**

1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — mirrors mvm; merged to
   iwlwifi-next/mainline; logic is a single missing call.
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — stale MLD state vs
   empty firmware after D3cold/hibernate resume.
3. Important issue? **PASS** — user-visible Wi-Fi recovery failure
   (HIGH, not panic). Fits “oh, that’s not good” / resume hardware path.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — ~4 insertions, one subsystem.
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS** — export existing helper + call it.
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — code present; patch already
   applies (already in v7.3-rc4).

**Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES**

Record: **None** (not a device ID / quirk table / DT / build / docs).
Qualifies as a normal small bugfix.

**Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION**

This tree is **7.3.0-rc4**. The MLD `device_powered_off` path exists
here and omitted restart cleanup until `71ac392d8b5c2`. The commit is a
4-line, low-risk fix for a real suspend/resume correctness bug on Intel
MLD hardware. It should be in this tree’s stable stream.

### What the commit solves (for 7.3 users)

On PCI resume, if the NIC was powered off, MLD only stopped firmware and
cleared `in_d3`. `iwl_mld_mac80211_start` then did a cold
`iwl_mld_start_fw()` **without** `iwl_mld_restart_cleanup()`, so
firmware IDs, keys, scan, and internal STAs stayed live in software. Wi-
Fi 7 devices can fail to recover after that suspend. The fix is the same
cleanup mvm already does.

Risk is a single call under the lock already used for restart cleanup.
Benefit is working wireless after D3cold/hibernate on common Intel
hardware.

- [Phase 6] `git describe HEAD` = v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37; `make
  kernelversion` 7.3.0-rc4
- [Phase 6] `git merge-base --is-ancestor 71ac392d8b5c2 HEAD`: yes
- [Phase 8] Failure mode inferred from code + mvm message (reload
  **and** reconfigure); no crash dump in commit (stated)
- UNVERIFIED: public user reports; whether older LTS without this commit
  would be in scope (out of band — this verdict is 7.3-rc4 only)

**YES**
