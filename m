net/smc: fix lgr/lnk lifetime vs diag reader race

This patch tries to close races between the SMC sock_diag dump and the
teardown of conn/lgr/lnk state. __smc_diag_dump() now skips the extension
attributes and the lgr based diag_mode test for sockets in SMC_INIT,
SMC_CLOSED or fallback, and several teardown paths unhash the socket
before smc_conn_free() or smcd_buf_detach(). It also adds acquire/release
ordering on sk_state and copies the cached link->ibname.

[Severity: Low]

The commit message says:

  Fourth, smc_listen_out_err() sets sk_state = SMC_CLOSED with a plain
  store after smc_conn_abort() -> smc_conn_free() has already cleared
  alert_token_local under write_lock_bh(). On weakly ordered CPUs a
  concurrent diag reader using smp_load_acquire() on sk_state can observe
  SMC_CLOSED while the preceding store to alert_token_local has not yet
  become visible, causing it to dereference an lgr whose reference was
  already dropped.

Is this still accurate with the current __smc_diag_dump()?

A reader that sees SMC_CLOSED now skips the conn->lgr dereference in the
diag_mode test, and the new goto out skips the extension blocks.

Before this store the state is SMC_INIT. smc_listen_work() holds the
socket lock until smc_listen_out(), so close_work can't change it in
between, and SMC_INIT is skipped the same way.

So whichever value the reader sees, it never reads alert_token_local or
conn->lgr, and the release ordering doesn't seem to protect anything the
reader relies on. The commit message already says this for the
stale-token case ("the SMC_CLOSED check in __smc_diag_dump() keeps the
reader from dereferencing conn->lgr").

This reasoning seems to date from v9, before v14 added SMC_CLOSED to the
diag_mode test. Could the fourth item be described as hardening, or
dropped, so stable backporters don't treat the barrier as a required
standalone fix?

[Severity: Medium]

This is a pre-existing issue and wasn't introduced by this patch. Does
smc_conn_free() leak the socket reference held by abort_work when it
cancels a pending abort_work?

smc_conn_free() in net/smc/smc_core.c does:

	} else {
		smc_cdc_wait_pend_tx_wr(conn);
		if (current_work() != &conn->abort_work)
			cancel_work_sync(&conn->abort_work);
	}

and ignores the return value. The only code that schedules abort_work is
smc_cdc_msg_validate(), and it hands a reference to the work:

		sock_hold(&smc->sk); /* sock_put in abort_work */
		if (!queue_work(smc_close_wq, &conn->abort_work))
			sock_put(&smc->sk);

smc_conn_abort_work() drops that reference when it runs. Suppose
abort_work is still pending when an SMC-R connection reaches
smc_conn_free() from outside abort_work, for example via __smc_release().
Then cancel_work_sync() returns true, nobody drops the reference, and the
smc_sock is never freed.

smc_close_cancel_work() handles close_work the same way with:

	if (cancel_work_sync(&smc->conn.close_work))
		sock_put(sk);

Should smc_conn_free() do the same for abort_work?

[Severity: Medium]

With this change every non-fallback socket in SMC_INIT or SMC_CLOSED is
reported as SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCR. That includes SMC-D connections, which
used to report SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCD.

include/uapi/linux/smc_diag.h defines diag_mode as:

/* Mode of a connection */
enum {
	SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCR,
	SMC_DIAG_MODE_FALLBACK_TCP,
	SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCD,
};

It has no "unknown" value. Is it intended that an SMC-D connection is
reported as SMC-R here?

Live SMC-D sockets can stay hashed in SMC_CLOSED with a valid lgr and
alert_token_local. smc_close_passive_work() or
smc_close_passive_abort_received() can move a socket to SMC_CLOSED while
the fd is still open. smc_close_passive_work() only unhashes and frees
when:

		if ((sk->sk_state == SMC_CLOSED) &&
		    (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD) || !sk->sk_socket)) {

SMC-D sockets in SMC_INIT after smc_conn_create() are affected the same
way. A tool that filters by mode (smcss -D / -R style) would put these
sockets in the wrong group.

Could the race be avoided without misreporting? For example, is_smcd
could be cached in the smc_sock, or SMC-D could be inferred from
conn.lgr != NULL && conn.lnk == NULL, which only reads pointers and
doesn't dereference the lgr.

[Severity: High]

Can a socket whose connection was already released by smc_conn_abort()
still move into a state this guard doesn't cover?

The guard only checks the sk_state snapshot. Take a client handshake
that fails with a negative rc after smc_conn_create():

smc_connect_rdma()
  connect_abort:
    smc_conn_abort()
      smc_conn_free()   /* sets conn->freed, drops lgr/lnk refs */

smc_connect_decline_fallback() returns early without changing the state,
and smc_connect_work() only does:

	rc = __smc_connect(smc);
	if (rc < 0)
		smc->sk.sk_err = -rc;

So the socket stays hashed in SMC_INIT with use_fallback == false.

Suppose smc_lgr_terminate_sched() had already emptied lgr->list, which
is the stale-token case the changelog mentions. Then smc_conn_free()
skips the unregister:

	if (!list_empty(&lgr->list)) {
		smc_buf_unuse(conn, lgr); /* allow buffer reuse */
		smc_lgr_unregister_conn(conn);
	}

alert_token_local stays non-zero and the conn stays in lgr->conns_all.

smc_cdc_rx_handler() doesn't check conn->freed:

	conn = smc_lgr_find_conn(ntohl(cdc->token), lgr);
	if (!conn || conn->out_of_sync) {

So a close or peer-abort CDC can still queue close_work. Once the
handshake thread drops the socket lock, smc_close_passive_work() does:

	case SMC_INIT:
		sk->sk_state = SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1;
		break;

Or smc_close_passive_abort_received() moves SMC_INIT to
SMC_PROCESSABORT. Both are plain stores, and neither path reaches the
new unhash plus smc_conn_free() branch.

A diag reader under read_lock(&h->lock) would then see APPCLOSEWAIT1 or
PROCESSABORT and pass both new checks. It would find
smc_conn_lgr_valid() true, because conn->lgr is never cleared. It then
dereferences smc->conn.lgr->is_smcd, conn->sndbuf_desc, conn->rmb_desc
and lgr->list.

Meanwhile terminate_work runs
__smc_lgr_terminate()->smc_conn_kill()->smc_close_active_abort(). Its
ACTIVE/APPCLOSEWAIT branch goes to SMC_CLOSED without unhashing:

	case SMC_ACTIVE:
	case SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1:
	case SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT2:
		sk->sk_state = SMC_PEERABORTWAIT;
		smc_close_cancel_work(smc);
		if (sk->sk_state != SMC_PEERABORTWAIT)
			break;
		sk->sk_state = SMC_CLOSED;
		sock_put(sk); /* (postponed) passive closing */

So the hash write_lock is never taken before smc_lgr_free() drops the
last lgr reference. Wouldn't the reader then be dereferencing a freed
smc_link_group?

There is also a weaker variant, where the token is cleared normally and
the lgr is freed synchronously via smc_lgr_cleanup_early(). Safety then
depends on the token clear being visible to a reader that acquire-loads
an sk_state written with a plain store. This is probably ordered in
practice through lock_sock()/release_sock(), but the patch doesn't
establish it.

Separately, after a failed handshake the same SMC_INIT to
SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1 transition later runs the "postponed passive closing"
sock_put() in smc_close_active() or smc_close_active_abort(). But
smc_connect_decline_fallback() has already dropped that reference.

Would one of these work better?

- unhash a socket whose conn was freed by smc_conn_abort(), or
  otherwise hide it from diag
- cancel close_work, or check conn->freed in smc_cdc_rx_handler() and
  in the diag reader
- pin the lgr for as long as stale conn state is visible

>  	    smc->conn.alert_token_local) {

[Severity: Medium]

This is a pre-existing issue and wasn't introduced by this patch. Is
req->diag_ext guaranteed to be inside the request payload here?

smc_diag_handler_dump() starts the dump after checking only:

	if (h->nlmsg_type == SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY &&
	    h->nlmsg_flags & NLM_F_DUMP) {

The generic __sock_diag_cmd() only checks for a struct sock_diag_req:

	if (nlmsg_len(nlh) < sizeof(*req))
		return -EINVAL;

That struct is 2 bytes. So an unprivileged SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY |
NLM_F_DUMP request for AF_SMC with a 2 byte payload is accepted. diag_ext
is at payload offset 3, past skb->len, in tailroom that
netlink_sendmsg() never initialized.

Those uninitialized bits then decide whether SMC_DIAG_CONNINFO,
SMC_DIAG_LGRINFO and SMC_DIAG_DMBINFO are emitted. That exposes the bits
to the requester, and KMSAN would report it as uninit-value.

inet_diag and unix_diag reject requests shorter than their family
request struct. Should smc_diag_handler_dump() also reject
nlmsg_len(h) < sizeof(struct smc_diag_req)?
