7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 5bdeca322a6f8d10acaf67cccab1f69747ee7be3 ]

scx_bypass() claims bypass dispatch when the scheduler's depth goes from
zero to one and releases it when the depth returns to zero, but propagates
only the depth to the descendants, not the claim. A descendant that starts
bypassing with its ancestor never claims, and one whose own bypass ends
under the ancestor's keeps its claim, as its depth does not return to zero.

A sub-scheduler enable whose bypass ends under a PM suspend thus leaks its
claim: the parent keeps hosting bypass dispatch and the sub-scheduler's next
bypass trips the WARN_ON_ONCE() on the claim. A sub-scheduler disable that
starts under a PM suspend has no claim, so once the resume lifts the root's
bypass its tasks sit on the parent's bypass DSQs with nobody consuming them.

Claim for every descendant whose depth goes from zero to one in the
propagation and release every scheduler in the subtree whose depth returned
to zero once the tasks have moved out of the bypass DSQs. A parent that is
bypassing itself when a descendant claims consumes only its own bypass DSQs,
empty until it leaves bypass and becomes the host.
