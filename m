[ Upstream commit 7bf6940d7cf41f1f0330a9bae4b7a886e18fd8e3 ]

ilo_pkt_dequeue() trusts descriptor IDs and lengths read from the shared
FIFO entry. A bad entry can select a descriptor outside the allocated
queue memory or report a packet length larger than one descriptor.

Reject entries whose descriptor index or packet length exceeds the queue
layout before deriving the packet pointer returned to read and write
paths.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

The local checkout is mainline **v7.3-rc4**. The hpilo driver has been
here since 2008, and this is a small bounds check on device-shared FIFO
fields used as a pointer and a copy length.

===============================================================
PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS
===============================================================

**Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE**
Record: **[misc: hpilo:] [validate] [reject out-of-range device FIFO
descriptor IDs and packet lengths before use]**

**Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS**
Record:
- Signed-off-by: Yousef Alhouseen \<alhouseenyousef@gmail.com\> (author)
- Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260624190919.3432-1-
  alhouseenyousef@gmail.com
- Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \<gregkh@linuxfoundation.org\> (misc
  maintainer; applied the patch)
- No Fixes:, Reported-by:, Tested-by:, Reviewed-by:, Acked-by:, or Cc:
  stable (absence of Fixes/Cc:stable is expected for this review)
- Pipeline markers (Sasha Levin SOB / Upstream commit) are not treated
  as selection evidence

**Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT**
Record:
- Bug: `ilo_pkt_dequeue()` uses descriptor ID and length from a FIFO
  shared with the HP iLO device with no bounds check.
- Symptom/failure mode: a bad ID indexes a descriptor outside the
  allocated queue; a bad length is larger than one descriptor. Those
  values feed `ilo_read()`/`ilo_write()`
  `copy_to_user`/`copy_from_user`.
- Version info: none in the message. The unvalidated path is from the
  original 2008 driver.
- Root cause (author): device-provided FIFO fields are trusted; the fix
  rejects ID ≥ `NR_QENTRY` or length > one descriptor before forming the
  packet pointer.

**Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES**
Record: Not a disguised cleanup. It is an explicit missing-validation /
OOB fix.

===============================================================
PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS - LINE BY LINE
===============================================================

**Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES**
Record:
- File: `drivers/misc/hpilo.c` (+6 / −1)
- Function: `ilo_pkt_dequeue()`
- Scope: single-file surgical fix

**Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE**
Record: After a successful `fifo_dequeue()`, the old code took `pkt_id =
get_entry_id(entry)` and used it as `desc + desc_mem_sz(pkt_id)`, and
passed `get_entry_len(entry)` out as `*len`. The new code stores the
length, returns 0 (dequeue failed) if `pkt_id >= NR_QENTRY` or `pkt_len
> desc_mem_sz(1)`, and only then fills `*id`/`*len`/`*pkt`. Normal path
for in-range entries is unchanged.

**Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM**
Record: **Memory safety / OOB (category d)** plus **logic correctness
(category g)**.
- `get_entry_id()` is a 12-bit field (0–4095). `NR_QENTRY` is 4.
  `desc_mem_sz(id)` is `id << 12`, so an ID of 5 already walks off the
  4×4KiB descriptor array; 4095 is a ~16MiB miss.
- `get_entry_len()` is a 10-bit qword count shifted by 3, so up to 8184
  bytes. One descriptor is 4096 bytes (`L2_QENTRY_SZ` 12). Recv
  descriptors sit at the end of the DMA allocation; a length of 8184 on
  the last slot reads/writes past `dma_size`.
- Callers: `ilo_read()` does `copy_to_user(buf, pkt, min(len,
  pkt_len))`; `ilo_write()` does `copy_from_user(pkt, buf, min(len,
  pkt_len))`. That is a host kernel OOB read or write, not just a bad
  error code.

**Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY**
Record: The checks match the layout from `ilo_ccb_setup()` (`NR_QENTRY`
descriptors of `desc_mem_sz(1)`). Open-time recv enqueue uses
`desc_mem_sz(1)` exactly, and `>` (not `>=`) still allows a full
4096-byte packet. Zero-length send packets used at open still pass.
Regression risk on working firmware is low: in-range entries are
unchanged. One caveat: `fifo_dequeue()` already advanced the head, so a
rejected entry is dropped and not re-queued; that can shrink the 4-slot
queue until close/reopen. That is acceptable fail-closed behavior, not a
behavior change for valid hardware.

===============================================================
PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION
===============================================================

**Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES**
Record: Unvalidated dequeue is from **89bcb05d9bbf8** (“HP iLO driver”,
David Altobelli, 2008-07-02). Present since v2.6.27-era. The validation
lines are this commit.

**Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG**
Record: No Fixes: tag. Not applicable. The introducing commit is the
original driver, which is an ancestor of this tree.

**Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES**
Record: Recent `drivers/misc/hpilo.c` work is device-number, class, DMA
API, and blacklist changes. No prerequisite refactor of the FIFO. After
this commit only a treewide `*_device_id` style change
(`f06bae4ddc70d`). Standalone.

**Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS**
Record: Author is not the hpilo maintainer (that is Keng-Yu Lin, HPE,
MAINTAINERS “Supported”). Same-day misc validation patches include
ibmvmc, xilinx_sdfec, bcm-vk, fastrpc — part of a large audit flood.
That is a quality-process note, not a substitute for reading this diff.
Greg Kroah-Hartman still applied this one.

**Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS**
Record: Uses existing `NR_QENTRY`, `desc_mem_sz()`, `get_entry_id()`,
`get_entry_len()`. No new helpers. Applies standalone.

===============================================================
PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH
===============================================================

**Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION**
Record: `b4 dig -c 7bf6940d7cf41` →
https://patch.msgid.link/20260624190919.3432-1-alhouseenyousef@gmail.com
- `b4 dig -a`: single v1, no later revisions
- lore.kernel.org fetches returned 403; body confirmed via openwall and
  lkml.iu.edu mirrors
- LKML index for late June 2026 lists the submission and **no** “Re:”
  for this hpilo patch (no NAK, no Cc: stable suggestion, no review
  thread)

**Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH**
Record: `b4 dig -w` recipients: Keng-Yu Lin (hpilo maintainer), Arnd
Bergmann, Greg Kroah-Hartman, linux-kernel. No Reviewed-by/Acked-by on
the commit. Greg’s SOB is the apply-to-char-misc path.

**Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT**
Record: No Reported-by, syzbot, bugzilla, or CVE in the commit or the
submission. Issue is identified by code inspection of the shared FIFO.

**Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES**
Record: Standalone `[PATCH]`, not `n/m`. Same-day author flood of
similar bounds checks; this patch does not depend on those.

**Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY**
Record: UNVERIFIED for stable@ lore (HTTP 403). No evidence in the v1
mail that anyone nominated or rejected it for stable.

===============================================================
PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
===============================================================

**Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS IN THE DIFF**
Record: `ilo_pkt_dequeue()` only.

**Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS**
Record (from `drivers/misc/hpilo.c`):
- `ilo_ccb_verify()` — open path, SENDQ, uses id only
- `ilo_read()` — `read(2)` on `/dev/hpilo/dXccbN`, RECVQ, uses id, len,
  pkt
- `ilo_write()` — `write(2)`, SENDQ, uses id, len, pkt

**Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES**
Record: `fifo_dequeue()` (consumes a C-bit entry under `fifo_lock`),
`get_entry_id()`, `get_entry_len()`, `desc_mem_sz()`.

**Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN**
Record: Userspace `read`/`write` on the char device → dequeue → copy.
FIFO payload is written by iLO firmware in shared DMA memory, then
marked consumed. An unprivileged process cannot poke FIFO fields
directly; it needs the device node **and** a bad/malicious iLO entry. On
ProLiant this driver is used by host management agents. Reachable in
production, not a dead path.

**Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS**
Record: This is the only dequeue that turns FIFO id/len into a host
pointer and copy size. No sibling copy of the same bug in this driver.

===============================================================
PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE
===============================================================

**Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?**
Record: Yes. Tree is **v7.3-rc4** (`7.3.0-rc4`, HEAD `f0100363d8c37`).
`drivers/misc/hpilo.c`/`hpilo.h` are present. `CONFIG_HP_ILO` exists.
Unvalidated dequeue is from 89bcb05d9bbf8 (2008). `git merge-base --is-
ancestor 7bf6940d7cf41 HEAD` is true — this checkout already contains
the fix because it is mainline after the char-misc merge, not because
the bug is absent.

**Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS**
Record: Expected apply: **clean**. `ilo_pkt_dequeue()` around the
dequeue site matches the parent of 7bf6940d7cf41 aside from this hunk.
No conflicting local churn.

**Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE**
Record: No earlier equivalent bounds check. This commit is the fix.

===============================================================
PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT
===============================================================

**Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY**
Record: **drivers/misc/hpilo** — HP iLO CHIF channel on ProLiant.
Criticality: **PERIPHERAL** for generic desktops, **IMPORTANT** for HP
enterprise servers that use `/dev/hpilo` (common on LTS/distro kernels).
Not mm/net/fs core.

**Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY**
Record: Mature, low-churn driver (2008), still Supported by HPE. Bug is
long-standing, not a brand-new API.

===============================================================
PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================

**Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED**
Record: **driver-specific / config-specific** (`CONFIG_HP_ILO`, PCI
iLO). HP ProLiant hosts running management userspace.

**Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS**
Record: Dequeue of a FIFO entry whose id or length is out of layout. The
device is expected to update recv length; a firmware length bug is the
realistic trigger. Malicious/compromised BMC is the security trigger.
Not a hot every-syscall path for machines without iLO. Unprivileged
users cannot inject FIFO fields without the device and a bad iLO entry.

**Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY**
Record: Kernel OOB read (`copy_to_user` in `ilo_read`) or OOB write
(`copy_from_user` in `ilo_write`) → oops, info leak, or memory
corruption. **Severity: HIGH** (crash/corruption; security-relevant if
firmware is untrusted). Not a guaranteed unprivileged LPE by itself.

**Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO**
Record:
- Benefit: **high for iLO users** — prevents host OOB from a bad FIFO
  entry on a long-lived production driver.
- Risk: **very low** — 6 lines, fail-closed, no API/lock/structure
  change; valid packets unaffected.
- Ratio: benefit outweighs risk.

===============================================================
PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS
===============================================================

**Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE**

FOR:
- Real missing bounds check on device-shared FIFO id/len used as pointer
  and copy length (verified in `ilo_read`/`ilo_write`).
- Failure mode is kernel OOB, not cosmetic.
- Driver and bug exist in this tree since 2008.
- 6-line, obviously correct check matching `NR_QENTRY` and
  `desc_mem_sz(1)`.
- No prerequisites; clean apply.
- Greg KH applied it; HPE maintainer was on Cc.
- HP iLO is real hardware on enterprise stable kernels.

AGAINST:
- No user report, syzbot, or CVE.
- Author is not the subsystem maintainer; patch is from a large same-day
  “validate X” sweep.
- No mailing-list review comments found.
- Official stable text dislikes unexplained “this could be a problem”
  issues; trigger depends on firmware producing a bad entry.
- Rejected entries are consumed and not recycled (queue-slot leak until
  reopen) — only if the device already posted garbage.

UNRESOLVED:
- Full lore.kernel.org / stable@ thread fetch (403).
- Whether Keng-Yu Lin privately acked (no Acked-by on the commit).

**Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — layout math matches the
   allocator; Greg merged it. No extra Tested-by.
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — unchecked device
   length/index on the read/write path. Not style.
3. Important issue (crash, security, corruption, deadlock)? **PASS** —
   OOB copy, oops/corruption; HIGH not a soft lockup.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — +6/−1, one function.
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**.
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — same `ilo_pkt_dequeue()`
   structure; driver present.

**Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES**
Record: None (not a device ID, quirk, DT, build, or doc-only change).
Qualifies as a normal small memory-safety fix.

**Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION**
This tree has the hpilo char device and the long-standing unvalidated
dequeue. The patch stops a bad device FIFO entry from becoming a kernel
pointer/length for `copy_{to,from}_user`. That is a real, contained OOB
fix with negligible regression risk on working iLO firmware. It meets
the stable rules for this checkout.

Verification:
- [Phase 1] Tags: author SOB, Link msgid, Greg KH SOB; no
  Fixes/Reported-by/Cc:stable
- [Phase 2] Diff: +6/−1 in `ilo_pkt_dequeue()`; reject `pkt_id >= 4` or
  `pkt_len > 4096`
- [Phase 2] Callers: `ilo_read` copy_to_user, `ilo_write`
  copy_from_user, `ilo_ccb_verify`
- [Phase 2] Bitfields: ID 12 bits (0–4095), len up to 8184, descriptor
  4096, `NR_QENTRY` 4
- [Phase 3] git blame: buggy dequeue from 89bcb05d9bbf8 (2008)
- [Phase 3] git log -- drivers/misc/hpilo.c: no FIFO refactor
  prerequisite; no follow-up fix
- [Phase 3] Author also submitted ibmvmc/xilinx_sdfec/bcm-vk validation
  patches; not hpilo maintainer
- [Phase 4] b4 dig: v1 only, lore msgid 20260624190919.3432-1; To/Cc
  includes Keng-Yu Lin, Arnd, Greg
- [Phase 4] openwall + lkml.iu.edu: patch body matches commit; no public
  Re: for hpilo
- [Phase 4] lore.kernel.org WebFetch: 403 — UNVERIFIED beyond mirrors
- [Phase 5] Call chain: userspace read/write on `/dev/hpilo/dXccbN`
  after device marks FIFO consumed
- [Phase 6] git describe HEAD: v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37; kernelversion
  7.3.0-rc4
- [Phase 6] merge-base --is-ancestor 7bf6940d7cf41 HEAD: yes (fix
  already on this mainline checkout)
- [Phase 6] Parent of fix: unvalidated `ilo_pkt_dequeue()` still in
  7bf6940d7cf41^
- [Phase 7] MAINTAINERS: HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE ILO CHIF DRIVER,
  Keng-Yu Lin, Supported
- [Phase 8] Failure mode: OOB read/write → oops/corruption, HIGH;
  trigger is bad iLO FIFO entry
- UNVERIFIED: stable@ mailing list discussion (fetch denied)

The fix is small, matches the queue layout in this tree, and prevents a
host OOB from a bad iLO FIFO entry.

**YES**
