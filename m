Subject: mm/mlock: use a long for the page count in mlock_fixup()
Date: Wed, 14 Oct 2026 09:13:58 -0400

mlock_fixup() adjusts mm->locked_vm, an unsigned long, by the number of
pages whose VM_LOCKED state it changes, but computes that number in an
int:

	int nr_pages;
	...
	nr_pages = (end - start) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
	...
	mm->locked_vm += nr_pages;

When a single VMA range of 2^31 pages (8 TiB with 4 KiB pages) or more
is locked or unlocked, the count is truncated to 32 bits and then
sign-extended, so locked_vm is changed by the wrong amount, while
munmap(), mremap() and the other paths that maintain locked_vm use the
full unsigned long page count.

Such a range is reachable on 64-bit architectures with a 47-bit or
larger user address space (x86_64, arm64 with 48-bit VA, riscv64 Sv48)
by a task with CAP_IPC_LOCK or a raised RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, which do_mlock()
checks against the full untruncated length.  It costs nothing with
MAP_NORESERVE and MLOCK_ONFAULT/MCL_ONFAULT, since then no page is
populated.  On x86_64, after

	p = mmap(NULL, 8UL << 40, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
		 MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0);
	mlock2(p, 8UL << 40, MLOCK_ONFAULT);

VmLck in /proc/self/status reads 18446744065119617024 kB instead of
8589934592 kB; munmap() of the region then subtracts the true size and
leaves VmLck at 18446744056529682432 kB instead of 0.  With 16 TiB,
locked_vm is not changed at all, VmLck stays 0 kB, and after the task
drops CAP_IPC_LOCK or lowers RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, mlock(), mmap(MAP_LOCKED)
and the other mlock_future_ok() and account_locked_vm() users enforce
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK against that count, so they let the task lock memory
beyond its limit (or, in the 8 TiB case, refuse every further lock).
The error persists for the life of the mm; unlocking the range in pieces
skews it further.  The wrong count is per-mm accounting only: it does
not change which pages are locked.

The int has been there since before git history (the variable was named
"pages" until it was renamed in 2.6.28); every other updater of
locked_vm uses an unsigned long or long count.  Make nr_pages a long,
which holds the page count of any user range and its negation, so the
existing sign handling is unchanged.

Found by formal verification of mm/mlock.c against the kernel binary.
