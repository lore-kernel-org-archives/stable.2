[ Upstream commit f6d61fe4c19cf448e5cba6d8767b4e6966f58606 ]

mana_rdma_remove() sets gd->rdma_teardown to stop
mana_rdma_service_handle() from acting on servicing events, but nothing
ever clears it. A hardware service reset (GDMA_EQE_HWC_RESET_REQUEST)
goes through mana_gd_suspend() -> mana_rdma_remove() and mana_gd_resume()
-> mana_rdma_probe(), so from the first reset onwards every
GDMA_EQE_HWC_SOC_SERVICE event returns early and RDMA suspend/resume
servicing is silently dropped for the life of the device.

gd->is_suspended has the same problem: it is set when servicing removes
the adev and is cleared only by a matching resume. A reset while RDMA is
suspended re-adds the adev but leaves is_suspended set, so a later resume
event calls add_adev() on top of a live gd->adev and leaks it. This is
currently masked by the rdma_teardown bug.

Clear both in mana_rdma_probe(). On the reset path mana_rdma_remove()
has closed the gate and drained the service workqueue, so clear
is_suspended first and re-open the gate with smp_store_release(), paired
with smp_load_acquire() in the handler, so the handler cannot observe an
open gate with a stale is_suspended. On the initial probe path the gate
was never closed and both flags are already clear.

This does not order gd->adev, which add_adev() publishes afterwards. A
servicing event arriving in that window is still dropped, as it is in
mainline today on the initial probe path; closing it needs probe and the
handler to be serialized and is left to a separate change.
