Well, the direct swapfile implementation bypasses the filesystem after
the header has been read and the on-disk blocks have been queried.  That
seems to be very much what it's designed to do.  It seems out of scope
for it to start trying to implement filesystem features like fscrypt
file contents encryption.  (Note that there's more to it than calling
fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx(), especially in current mainline.)  After
all, we also wouldn't expect it to understand and implement the
compression, checksums, etc. features of various filesystems.

Yes, when people encrypt their swap, they of course use an ephemeral
key.  However, they use either dm-crypt, or a loop device on top of an
fscrypt file.  (Note that if they use zram with a backing file, they
*have* to use a block device anyway.)

Fortunately, I've never heard of someone actually using the direct
swapon() with an fscrypt file, which is what this patch pertains to.
This case was just found by an LLM review.  I don't think we need to add
a new feature here; we should just remove the footgun just in case.
