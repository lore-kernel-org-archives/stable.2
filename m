  Hi Dave,

  Understood - I'll treat the doc as a working draft and wait for your 
series rather than building on the plan as posted.

Thanks for the answers. On Q2 I mis-derived "old-log only" from
xlog_write_partial()'s refill check - the start record being its own
empty ophdr in xlog_cil_build_trans_hdr() makes the point, and the
pre-refactor writer could emit the zero-length trans header fragment
at the iclog boundary outright. Accepted, and agreed that special
case needs to go.

Once your series is posted I'll start with review and the
recoveryloop / logprint-based testing, then take the per-type
validate_region() / validate_item() implementations on top of your
iterator.

Thanks,
Hongling
