6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Itai Handler <itai.handler@gmail.com>

commit e922bad8b2d5028c51a096d083fea41cd0987154 upstream.

The driver has no ->shutdown, and platform_drv_shutdown() has no
fallback of its own.  Unlike pci_device_shutdown(), which clears bus
mastering when kexec_in_progress, nothing on the platform bus disarms a
device that can still write to memory.  The normal kexec path never
calls ->suspend either, so the quiesce in zynqmp_qspi_suspend() is not
reached.

A controller that is still executing a DMA read may therefore keep
writing to memory across a kexec.  QSPIDMA_DST_ADDR still points at
memory owned by the kernel that called kexec, DST_SIZE is non-zero and
the flash is still clocked, so data can keep landing in RAM while the
new kernel is being relocated, and after it has started executing.

That destination is a physical address which means nothing to the new
kernel, so the writes can corrupt whatever now occupies it: kernel text
or data, page tables, or the initrd.  Nothing reports an error and the
resulting behaviour is undefined.

This can be observed by reading GQSPI_EN (offset 0x114) and
QSPIDMA_DST_ADDR/SIZE/STS/CTRL (offsets 0x800 to 0x80c) early in the new
kernel, before the driver probes: without this patch GQSPI_EN reads 1
and QSPIDMA_DST_ADDR still points into the previous kernel's memory.

Add a ->shutdown that stops the controller the way zynqmp_qspi_suspend()
already does.  spi_controller_suspend() stops the queue, waits for a
message that is already executing and makes any later transfer fail with
-ESHUTDOWN, so nothing can be cut short by the register write that
follows.  It may sleep, which is fine here: device_shutdown() runs in
process context.  Unlike ->suspend this cannot abort on error, because a
controller left mastering the bus is worse than a truncated transfer, so
a failure to drain is only logged.

GQSPI_EN_OFST is then cleared, as zynqmp_qspi_remove() and
zynqmp_qspi_suspend() already do.  Skip that write only when
pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() returns 0, i.e. runtime suspended: the clocks
are gated, so the registers are unreachable and the controller cannot be
mastering the bus.  A negative return is not the same thing - it is what
the CONFIG_PM=n stub always returns, and there probe() has enabled pclk
and refclk for good, so the controller is running and must be stopped.

[ itai: context only - zynqmp_qspi_of_match[] still sits between
  zynqmp_qspi_remove() and MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() in this tree, hoisted to
  the top of the file upstream by commit 29f4d95b97bc ("spi:
  spi-zynqmp-gqspi: Add tap delay support for GQSPI controller on Versal
  platform"), so zynqmp_qspi_shutdown() is placed above it ]
