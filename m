Subject: mm/vma: avoid spurious write locks when mm->mm_lock_seq overflows
Date: Thu, 15 Oct 2026 21:31:44 +0100

So far the assumption has been that mm->mm_lock_seq overflow is benign,
resulting only in readers spuriously falling back to the mmap lock, however
it turns out that this was an unsafe assumption.

If a VMA can be spuriously considered write locked that means read lock
exclusion does not take place, and thus a VMA can end up write-locked with
concurrent readers.

Since overflow only occurs every 2^31 write lock/unlock cycles, resolve the
issue by resetting every VMA's vma->vm_lock_seq each time such an overflow
occurs.

This is done in vma_end_write_all(), which is called when the mmap write
lock is released, i.e. in mmap_write_unlock() and mmap_write_downgrade().

Care must be taken, as resetting the sequence count at overflow means
changing the seqcount of VMAs which are already attached and observable.

The mm's seqcount is guaranteed to be odd when a write lock is held, and
thus any write locked VMA will have an odd seqcount assigned.

Therefore resetting to an even value prevents spurious write locks, since
these can only occur with the mmap write lock held, at which point the mmap
seqcount will be odd.

However, vma_start_read() also checks vma->vm_lock_seq == mm->mm_lock_seq,
bailing if so (indicating a write lock).

This would cause any even reset value chosen to prevent VMA read locks from
being taken - avoid this by also checking whether the VMA seqcount is odd
before bailing on the read lock.

So far, vma->vm_lock_seq has defaulted to UINT_MAX, but this has been
unnecessary since commit e5e7fb278e59 ("mm: convert mm_lock_seq to a proper
seqcount"), since this is assigned when the VMA is still detached, and
cannot be observed.

Therefore perform both reset and initialisation of vma->vm_lock_seq by
simply setting vma->vm_lock_seq to zero.

The reset, performed in reset_vma_seqcounts(), only needs to WRITE_ONCE()
the value. The stores follow the smp_wmb() in do_raw_write_seqcount_end(),
so a reader observing a reset value also observes the VMA modifications
made under the write lock.

Since all VMA write locks were just released and the mmap write lock is
still held, there are no concurrent VMA writers.

Concurrent VMA readers are unaffected. New VMA readers observe either zero,
never a write lock, or the prior seqcount, behaving as before the reset.

Since this only occurs every 2^31 write lock/unlock cycles, the time taken
to update all VMAs is considered to be acceptable.

Also update comments, documentation and VMA userland tests to reflect the
change.
