7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>

commit d74d66aa708ccf2bc0b1e265a83fed0f2308d5c4 upstream.

attach_recursive_mnt() transfers MNT_LOCKED from the top mount to the
mount that is moved beneath it with MOVE_MOUNT_BENEATH. This allows the
owner of a user namespace to replace its locked /proc or its root. The
mount beneath takes on the job of covering the underlying mountpoint
allowing the top mount to be unmounted.

Consider two mount namespaces:

(H) The host H has a shared mount P with a secret in P/d
(Z) Z is a user namespace made from M. Its copy of P receives
    propagation from the host's P and its copy of M's cover on P/d is
    locked Z's owner must not get to see P/d.

Now (H) mounts X on P/d. This propagates into (Z). The copy of X lands
beneath (Z)'s locked cover. The locked property is transfered from (Z)'s
cover to the copy of X propagated beneath it. The cover is now unlocked.

Now (H) unmounts X again. The copy of X in (Z) gets unmounted and the
covering mount is left unlocked on top of P/d. (Z) can now unmount it:

    Z: umount2(P/d)             = EINVAL            /* the cover is locked */
    H: mount X on P/d, umount X                     /* both propagate into Z /*
    Z: umount2(P/d)             = 0                 /* the cover is now unlocked */
    Z: read P/d/secret          = "covered-by-root" /* secret revealed */

So only transfer the locked property to the mount beneath for mounts the
caller has placed. A propagated copy that lands beneath a locked mount
is locked as well so that the mount at the bottom of the stack carries a
lock the way every check expects. The mount on top of it remains locked
to ensure that it keeps covering even if the propagated mount is
unmounted again.
