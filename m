This one was found by code review.  But the latency spike has been
observed in other cases with missing vzeroupper, so it's definitely a
real effect at least on some CPUs.

It's awkward to mark something as a fix, then not actually want it to be
fixed everywhere.  The stable maintainers know this, and they often
apply fixes anyway regardless of 'Cc stable'.

And if vzeroupper is really not safe due to ZenBleed, then why is it
used everywhere else in the kernel?  This is just one of the few
exceptions that doesn't have it.  If it's not safe then they should all
be alternatives that patch them out to no-ops on affected CPUs.

But since that was never implemented, and userspace almost always uses
vzeroupper too, it seems the only real solution is the microcode.  I
don't think it makes sense to have a middle ground where almost all of
userspace uses vzeroupper, ~97% of the kernel uses vzeroupper, and a
random 3% of the kernel doesn't use it.
