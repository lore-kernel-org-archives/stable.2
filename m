7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>

commit f6310491c4cdb88af73aa551ec9df1f10a90c709 upstream.

svc_set_num_threads() spreads the requested threads evenly across the
service's pools (base = nrservs / sv_nrpools).  When a service runs
fewer threads than it has pools -- e.g. an nfsd configured with fewer
threads than the host has NUMA nodes while running in "pernode" or
"percpu" mode -- the trailing pools are left with no threads at all.

svc_xprt_enqueue() selects a pool from the CPU servicing the transport,
queues the transport on that pool's sp_xprts, and only wakes a thread
from the same pool.  Each thread services exclusively its own pool, so a
transport that lands on a threadless pool is enqueued on sp_xprts and
never picked up: the connection hangs indefinitely.

Have svc_pool_for_cpu() skip pools that currently have no threads,
falling back to the next populated pool.  This trades NUMA locality for
a guarantee that the work is actually serviced.  sp_nrthreads is only
updated under the service mutex; the lockless read here is a best-effort
routing hint, so annotate it with data_race().
