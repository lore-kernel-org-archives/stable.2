6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 258e231dc29fbd72bc82c16859a8304f71780ba2 ]

There are only two callers of __pm_runtime_disable(), one of which is
device_suspend_late() and the other is pm_runtime_disable() that has
its own kerneldoc comment and there are no plans to add any more of
them.  Since they use different values of the __pm_runtime_disable()
second parameter, the actual code behavior is different in each case,
but it is all documented in the __pm_runtime_disable() kerneldoc comment
which is not particularly straightforward.

For this reason, move the information from the __pm_runtime_disable()
kerneldoc comment to the pm_runtime_disable() one and into a separate
comment in device_suspend_late() and remove the __pm_runtime_disable()
kerneldoc comment altogether.

No functional impact.
