7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Karl Mehltretter <kmehltretter@gmail.com>

commit 2f6fc0612607c95489c960aaefc8cb5578cdab8c upstream.

Commit 7f1635737823 ("arm64: proton-pack: Fix hard lockup due to print in
scheduler context") moved the "mitigation disabled" printks into
spectre_print_disabled_mitigations(). For spectre-v2 and spectre-v4 only
the pr_info_once() calls were removed, but for spectre-bhb the whole
branch went with the print:

  -   } else if (cpu_mitigations_off() || __nospectre_bhb) {
  -           pr_info_once("spectre-bhb mitigation disabled ...\n");

spectre_bhb_enable_mitigation() therefore no longer tests __nospectre_bhb
or cpu_mitigations_off() and the mitigation is enabled regardless of the
command line. The parameter is still parsed and its flag is still checked
by spectre_print_disabled_mitigations(), so the kernel prints "spectre-bhb
mitigation disabled by command-line option" while
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 reports "Mitigation:
CSV2, BHB" and the vectors are switched to EL1_VECTOR_BHB_LOOP.

The only remaining escape is the SPECTRE_VULNERABLE arm at the top of the
chain, which a CSV2 core never reaches, so from Cortex-A76 and Neoverse N1
onwards both nospectre_bhb and mitigations=off are ignored. Both are
documented in Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt.

The identical mistake was made on the neighbouring compile-time-option
branch immediately before this regression and fixed shortly afterwards;
this command-line branch was missed.
build_bhb_mitigation() in arch/arm64/net/bpf_jit_comp.c still tests both
flags, so nospectre_bhb currently keeps the exception-vector loop while
dropping the cBPF epilogue mitigation.

Restore the check, folded into a spectre_bhb_mitigations_off() helper
alongside its spectre_v2/v4 counterparts, and use it for the boot-time
print in spectre_print_disabled_mitigations() as well. The print itself
already lives there and does not need restoring.

Tested under QEMU with -cpu neoverse-n1 (CSV2, no ECBHB, no CLRBHB).
Before, spectre_v2 read "Mitigation: CSV2, BHB" with and without the
option; after, nospectre_bhb and mitigations=off both give "Mitigation:
CSV2, but not BHB" and a boot without either is unchanged.
