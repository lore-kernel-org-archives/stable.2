Hi Dust,

After debugging further, I believe that __smcr_link_clear() cannot be
called from smc_switch_link_and_count() because
refcount_dec_and_test(&lnk->refcnt) is always false on that path — the
initial ref (set in smcr_link_init(), released only in
smcr_link_clear()) is always held while the switch executes. So there is
no UAF from that path. The only consequence is that the diag reader may
observe a stale conn->lnk pointer value — pointing to the old link which
is still fully live — and read the old link's ibport/link_id/ibname from it.

The real UAF is via smc_conn_free(): it drops both the connection-owned
conn->lnk reference via smcr_link_put() and the connection-owned
conn->lgr reference via smc_lgr_put(), while the socket is still visible
in the hash table. For conn->lgr this means kfree(lgr) can race with the
diag reader dereferencing lgr->is_smcd, lgr->role, lgr->list etc. For
conn->lnk this means memset(lnk, 0, ...) in __smcr_link_clear() can race
with the diag reader dereferencing link->smcibdev->ibdev->name. The
current patch tries to fix this using lgr_lnk_lock. Since you suggested
we fix it with *unhash-before-free*, I thought about it and here is my
proposal.

Proposed fix (high level):

Introduce a smc_conn_unhash() helper with a per-connection unhashed flag
that ensures the socket is removed from the hash table exactly once.
Call it at the top of smc_conn_free(), before any lgr/lnk references are
dropped.

This establishes the invariant: any socket still visible to the diag
reader under read_lock(hash->lock) has valid conn->lgr and conn->lnk
pointers. The mutual exclusion between write_lock_bh(hash->lock) inside
smc_conn_unhash() and the diag reader's read_lock(hash->lock) ensures
that by the time smcr_link_put() runs in smc_conn_free(), the socket is
already gone from the hash — the diag reader either completes before the
unhash or never sees the socket at all.

The unhashed flag is needed because smc_conn_free() can be called from
multiple paths (e.g. smc_conn_kill() ahead of __smc_release()), so we
need to guarantee the unhash happens exactly once.

Does this design look reasonable to you?

There is a separate minor issue — smc_switch_link_and_count() updates
conn->lnk under send_lock while the diag reader loads it without any
lock, which can cause stale ibport/link_id/ibname in *smcss -R* during a
failover event. This is a data race but not a safety issue since the
link struct is always live at that point.

This race is very rare in practice — it requires a concurrent smcss -R
dump to hit the exact CPU-cycle window during a conn->lnk pointer write,
which itself only happens during an exceptional link failover event.
Even when it occurs, the effect is transient: one dump may show the old
link's ibport/link_id/ibname, and the next dump will show the correct
values.
