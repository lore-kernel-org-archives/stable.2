AUTOSEL mostly works within our existing process. The only other extra it gets
are those AUTOSEL tagged mails that give folks additional few weeks to review
those commits vs those commits just going in our queue directly.

I'm not sure we want to reduce the review period here: folks argued in the past
to make it longer (it used to be a week, and about a year or two ago became ~3
weeks).

Otherwise, you'd get the same emails and these AUTOSEL picks would follow
exactly the same process as any other stable pick.
