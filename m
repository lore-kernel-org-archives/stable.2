6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

From: Federico Musto <federico@rimpianto.com>

[ Upstream commit c4ba1716853de5178a9df785844ebb5e397a80e6 ]

atl1c sizes its receive buffers from the netdev MTU plus a fixed set of L2
overheads, which comes to 1522 bytes at the default MTU.  A link partner
that sends a longer frame - in practice a MikroTik CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe,
whose RouterOS side defaults to l2mtu 1600 while the host stays at MTU 1500
- makes the length reported by the RX return descriptor exceed what the
hardware wrote, and skb_put() then either includes bytes that were never
received or trips skb_over_panic and takes the host down.

Compare the descriptor length against buffer_info->length, the length the
hardware was given, rather than against skb_tailroom(): the skb carries 64
bytes of slack for the DMA erratum, so tailroom is larger than the DMA
buffer and a frame in between would pass the check and still be delivered
with a tail the device never wrote.  The same test rejects frames shorter
than ETH_HLEN + ETH_FCS_LEN; before this change a reported length below
ETH_FCS_LEN underflowed in skb_put().

The frame is dropped with kfree_skb_reason(SKB_DROP_REASON_PKT_TOO_BIG) so
drop_monitor and the kfree_skb tracepoint see it, and counted through
dev_core_stats_rx_dropped_inc(), which survives atl1c_get_stats()
overwriting the hardware counters on every read.  It also counts as work:
atl1c_clean_rfd() has already recycled the RFD, and the refill at the end
of the poll only runs when work_done is non-zero, so sustained oversized
traffic would otherwise drain the ring and stop RX.

Tested on a MikroTik CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe (4x AR8151) in a Proxmox VE host,
with atl1c built from a DKMS tree carrying this change: the l2mtu-1600
traffic that panics the stock driver is dropped and counted with the patch
applied, and received normally once the host MTU is raised to match.

This complements commit 36c2009d90f2 ("net: atl1c: fix soft lockup on
out-of-range tpd_cons read"), which fixed the TX side of the same
"host dies while the card resets" problem.
