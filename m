7.3-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

[ Upstream commit 68a95c3968895cd198f42baadb23e635fecc5a66 ]

A push makes the node the new tail, and then links it to its predecessor.
In between the queue isn't empty, but mpscq_pop() can't get at the node.
The consumers deal with that by trying again, with a cond_resched() in
the loop to give a preempted producer the chance to finish.

cond_resched() doesn't do that if the consumer has a higher priority than
the producer and both have to use the same CPU:

  producer (SCHED_OTHER)              consumer (SCHED_FIFO), same CPU
  io_req_local_work_add()
    mpscq_push()
      prev = xchg(&q->tail, node)
  <preempted>                         io_cqring_wait()
                                        __io_run_local_work()
                                      again:
                                          cond_resched()  // nothing to do
                                          mpscq_pop()     // NULL
                                          // work pending, no events yet
                                          goto again

The producer can be any task that is able to queue task_work for the
ring: an io-wq worker, or somebody who sends a message with
IORING_OP_MSG_RING. The consumer spins, holding ->uring_lock, until the
scheduler takes pity on the fair class, which takes about a second with
the default settings of the fair server, and forever without it. The
loops in tctx_task_work_run() and io_cancel_local_task_work() have the
same problem.

Don't allow preemption between the two steps. That bounds the time the
window is open on the CPU of the producer by what interrupts take, and a
consumer that waits for that is on another CPU. The cost is a
preempt_disable()/preempt_enable() pair per push.
