Thanks for posting the WIP series.

I’ll work from the log-verification-1 branch and first study the generic
iterator and item handling rather than extending the old special cases.
I’ll pay particular attention to arbitrary continuation fragments,
zero-length first fragments, transaction-header completion, and cleanup
on malformed input.

I’ll review the existing code for bugs before adding the per-item 
validation functions, and will point you to my repository once I have
work based on the branch.

Thanks,
Hongling
