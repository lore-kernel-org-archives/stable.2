It took me a bit of staring to (hopefully) understand better how
dl_bw_gen works, maybe the following can help others?

 /*

  *  - One behind: the clear that just ran wiped it. The rebuild puts

  *
  * Only equalities are compared, so the wrap of the counter is

Maybe additional info can again help (before the above)?

Can something like the following happen? And do we actually have a test
for it?

1. T departs. A SCHED_DEADLINE task with bandwidth X leaves the class
asleep, 0-lag still ahead. Per the design, X stays counted in rd(A)'s
total_bw; T goes on dl_departed_list with dl_departed_cpu = A, and the
inactive timer is armed as the designated releaser. So far so good — the
record says "rd( A) owes X on T's behalf."

2. T migrates. T is now a fair task; it wakes and gets placed on a CPU
in a different root domain, rd(B). task_cpu(T) = B.

3. T is PI-boosted back. A deadline waiter blocks on a mutex T holds ->
rt_mutex_setprio -> class change -> switched_to_dl():
   - cancel_inactive_timer() — the designated releaser is cancelled;
   - dl_task_undepart() — T is delisted and dl_departed_cpu is reset to −1.

   X is still sitting in rd(A)'s total_bw, but nothing anywhere
   remembers that. T runs in rd(B) on its donor's reservation.

4. The boost ends. T is deboosted out of the class -> switched_from_dl()
-> task_non_contending() -> dl_task_release_bw(p, task_cpu(p)). T is not on
the departed list, so the passed-in CPU is used: X is subtracted from
rd(B).

...

Apart from the above, the proposed approach looks alright. I now wonder,
though, if an overall different scheme might make more sense. The
half-baked solution we have today for rebuilding bandwidth information
after domain changes is based on cpusets keeping track of DEADLINE tasks
(with the indirect cpu <-> rd association complicating things further).
With dl_departed_list, we now have one half of a per-domain membership
structure; the accounted current tasks are the other half. Wouldn't it
be better to move to a single list of accounted tasks (current and
departed alike), keyed by their recorded home CPU, which turns the
rebuild from a reconstruction into a re-partition? The dl_bw_gen
machinery and the cpuset walk would both go away. I understand this
would require some major restructuring of a number of patches in this
set, so maybe we can think of doing it after this set lands (or the
majority of the patches in here). Unless you are open to trying the idea
(if it makes any sense) and see if it simplifies things?

Thanks,
Juri
