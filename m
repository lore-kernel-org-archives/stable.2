xfs_fs_commit_blocks() converts whatever range a pNFS client commits.
For a range without blocks, the conversion allocates blocks that the
transaction did not reserve and shuts XFS down, or maps blocks that
nobody wrote into the file. Patch 1 refuses such a commit with a new
XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT_ONLY flag for xfs_bmapi_write(). Patch 2 clamps the
committed length before adding it to the offset, as the sum can wrap.

Changes in v2:
- Refuse the hole in xfs_bmapi_write() with a new
  XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT_ONLY flag, as Christoph suggested, instead of
  checking all the ranges first. A range before the hole is now
  converted before the commit fails; v1 converted nothing.
- Drop the blockgc case from the message: with "xfs: mark the inode
  preallocated for pNFS write layouts past EOF" [1], blockgc keeps
  those blocks.
- Split the length clamp into patch 2. It fixes a separate bug.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261013-xfs-pnfs-commit-hole-v1-1-740912db9102@samsung.com

XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT_ONLY takes bit 12 of the bmapi flags, which "xfs: add
XFS_BMAPI_UNWRITTEN to unmap unwritten extents in __xfs_bunmapi()" in
the fs-verity series [2] also uses. Whichever goes in second needs to
move to bit 13. The name was used before, by a flag that commit
26b91c728b2d ("xfs: make COW fork unwritten extent conversions more
robust") removed. That flag only skipped the allocation and went on to
map the hole; this one stops before it.

This series and v2 of "xfs: make pNFS LAYOUTCOMMIT stable the way
fdatasync does", sent at the same time, both change
xfs_fs_commit_blocks(). They apply in either order.

Tested on nfsd-testing d918c664efd5 with the same two patches on top,
in QEMU guests with KASAN and lockdep. The block layout was on an
NVMe/TCP namespace exported by nvmet. The client was pynfs, except for
fstests, which ran on the Linux NFSv4.2 client. XFS for-next also has
commit e3c682dd1130 ("xfs: map pNFS layouts to the end of the extent
again"), which nfsd-testing does not have. xfs_bmapi_write(),
xfs_iomap_write_unwritten(), xfs_fs_commit_blocks() and
xfs_dio_write_end_io() are the same in both trees, and so is the
changed line in xfs_end_ioend_write().

 - A LAYOUTCOMMIT of a 64 KiB hole: NFS4ERR_IO and shutdown without the
   series. With it, NFS4ERR_IO, no shutdown and nothing allocated, in 5
   runs.
 - A LAYOUTCOMMIT of a 4 KiB hole: NFS4_OK and a written block in the
   file without the series. With it, NFS4ERR_IO and nothing allocated.
 - The laid-out range and the 64 KiB hole in one LAYOUTCOMMIT: shutdown
   without the series. With it, NFS4ERR_IO, and fiemap on the server
   shows the laid-out range written and nothing allocated in the hole.
 - An extent at 4 KiB with a length of 2^64 - 4 KiB: NFS4ERR_IO and
   "nfsd: non-standard errno: -63" without the series, and with
   XFS_DEBUG "Assertion failed: bma.nallocs >= *nmap" in
   xfs_bmapi_write(). With patch 1 alone, the same nfsd warning. With
   both, NFS4ERR_IO and no warning, also with XFS_DEBUG.
 - Blocks past EOF freed by blockgc under a layout, without [1]: the
   LAYOUTCOMMIT after the client's write shut XFS down without the
   series and got NFS4ERR_IO with it.
 - pynfs block and blockextent, also with XFS_DEBUG: same as without
   the series (BLOCK3 fails either way, on a bug in the test).
 - fstests generic/075, 091 and 263 over the block layout: 075 fails
   with an fsx size error with and without the series, and XFS refused
   none of the 10384 LAYOUTCOMMITs with it.
 - O_DIRECT and buffered writes into preallocated space on the
   server's own XFS, the other callers of xfs_iomap_write_unwritten():
   converted as before, on the XFS_DEBUG kernel.
 - fstests -g quick on a local XFS (mkfs.xfs defaults from xfsprogs
   6.6.0, 10 GiB TEST and SCRATCH devices, KASAN and lockdep off),
   with and without the series: 1017 tests ran, and the same 5 failed
   either way (generic/453, 454, 563, 794 and xfs/261). Also the same
   with both series applied.
 - W=1 builds of the changed files after each patch, on XFS for-next
   0be6da616ab5 and on nfsd-testing: no warnings.

No test reaches the delalloc case of the new flag. It takes the same
branch as a hole.

For stable, patch 2 applies to every LTS tree, but should not go in
without patch 1: on its own, the clamped extent reaches the hole and
shuts XFS down, as a LAYOUTCOMMIT of a hole already does there. Patch 1
needs a backport for 7.2 and older, which do not have
fs/xfs/xfs_ioend.c.

xfs_pnfs_validate_isize() reads the extents under XFS_ILOCK_SHARED,
which xfs_iread_extents() does not allow when they are not loaded yet.
That needs a separate fix.
