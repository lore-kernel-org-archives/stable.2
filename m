Subject: mm/zswap: drop the stale zswap entry of a zero folio
Date: Wed, 04 Nov 2026 00:18:14 +0800

Patch series "mm/swap, zswap: fix stale zswap data and swap-in bugs", v2.

There are some bug fixes found by AI and collected by David, mostly
originally from Anthropic.  After filtering and dropping a few that are
already being patched up by the community [1] [2], these are the 3 we
kept.  The accounting fix is in two patches now, the second one from
Johannes to cover asynchronous devices too.

Patches 1 and 2 are marked for stable, they affect v6.12 and later.
Patches 3 and 4 only affect v7.3 and later, so they are not marked for
stable.

The zswap bug in patch 1 can return stale data instead of the zeroes that
were written, so it is data corruption and seems critical.  The extent
fix in patch 2 is more urgent than it might look, as it can also read in
unexpected data, but the setup could be really rare.

For the extent fix, in the long term we might actually want to detect
extent contiguity and allow mTHP swap-in for single-extent swap files.
We already disable mTHP allocation for swap files, so the current fix is
trivial. It seems the most minimal and correct one for now.
Optimization and cleanups can come later.

Patch 3 gives up readahead batching for synchronous devices, as its


This patch (of 4):

A folio can stay in the swap cache after zswap_store() has stored it,
when a swapin fault gets a reference on it before reclaim can remove it.
do_swap_page() maps an exclusive folio writable and, for a read fault,
keeps it in the swap cache, so it can be modified and swapped out again
to the same slot. zswap_store() handles this, it replaces the old entry,
or drops it if the store fails or zswap got disabled, "otherwise,
writeback could overwrite the new data in the swapfile".

swap_writeout() does not get as far as zswap_store() if the folio is
zero-filled now. It only sets the zero flag of the slot, and the zswap
entry with the previous contents stays in the tree and on the LRU:

  reclaim            fault              zswap shrinker
  zswap_store(D1)
                     swap cache hit,
                     map, write zeroes
  swap_writeout()
    zero flag set
  folio reclaimed
                                        zswap_writeback_entry()
                                          swap_cache_alloc_folio()
                                          decompress D1, uptodate
                     swap cache hit:
                     maps D1

Swapin looks at the zero flag first, but only when it has to read the
folio. The folio that zswap writeback leaves in the swap cache is up to
date as far as anybody can tell, so the process gets its old data back
instead of the zeroes it has written, until that folio is reclaimed.

Invalidate the zswap entries in the zero-filled case as well. The folio
is locked and in the swap cache, which keeps zswap writeback away.
