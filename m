[ Upstream commit e31d761628ad7e96490fc78105ed0a064ec1c1d9 ]

These NICs are often reported to lose their Bluetooth interfaces, i.e,
their USB interfaces suddenly become completely unresponsive, causing
the USB core to reset them, only to find that they are no longer
accessible. A power cycle is required to make the Bluetooth interfaces
recover.

After some investigations, I found that their USB autosuspend remote
wakeup capabilities are so broken that they are precisely the culprit
behind the issue:

  [27585.528424] hub 3-0:1.0: state 7 ports 5 chg 0000 evt 0020

To reproduce the issue, these conditions must be met:
- a noisy radio environment (cafe or office) to cause frequent remote
  wakeup events
- no Bluetooth device is connected, so autosuspend is not prohibited
- the Bluetooth interface is opened, so remote wakeup is enabled when
  the device runs into autosuspend

Then I can reproduce the issue within sereval hours each time.

Increasing TRSMRCY or setting USB_QUIRK_RESET doesn't help at all.

Since the remote wakeup capability is super broken, just disable it to
get rid of the troubles. The device can still be autosuspended when
the bluetooth interface is closed, which won't break the device as
remote wakeup is unneeded in this case.
