The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm: memcontrol: raise MEMCG_MAX for charges that fail without reclaiming
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-memcontrol-raise-memcg_max-for-charges-that-fail-without-reclaiming.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: mm: memcontrol: raise MEMCG_MAX for charges that fail without reclaiming
Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2026 10:48:35 -0700

Charges that exceed memory.max and return through the nomem label can
raise no event and simply return -ENOMEM.

A non-blocking charge can hit the limit, get rejected, but is not visible
in memory.events.

This was noticed in a production setting where bpf_mem_alloc() attempted
to refill its per-cpu freelists, which triggered a non-blocking charge
while at the limit.

Commit d6e103a757fa ("mm: memcontrol: do not miss MEMCG_MAX events for
enforced allocations") added raised_max_event to cover charges that are
force charged without ever reaching reclaim, but charges that are rejected
outright were left out.  Getting an allocation failure without the
corresponding MEMCG_MAX event is unexpected and makes debugging and
monitoring harder.

Raise the event on the way out for rejected charges as well, by routing
the -ENOMEM return through the same exit path that already covers forced
charges.  The existing behavior of raising a MEMCG_MAX event on every
charge/reclaim/retry iteration is left unchanged.

Tested with a module that performs accounted GFP_NOWAIT page allocations
from a task in a cgroup at its memory.max, and measures the resulting
memory.events:max delta.  Without this patch the rejected charges raise no
event at all; with it the delta matches the number of rejected charges
exactly.  A GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_NORETRY control, which reaches reclaim,
raises the same two events per failed charge before and after, confirming
the existing charge/reclaim/retry accounting is unchanged.
