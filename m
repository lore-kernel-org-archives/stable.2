On s390 arch, the hardware memory model provides strong ordering — all
loads are ordered with respect to prior loads, so the speculative load
scenario described in this comment cannot occur there.

For the race to be observable on arm64 or any other weakly ordered arch,
all of the following must be true simultaneously:

1) A diag dump is actively running (smcss or a monitoring tool).
2) A connection is in the narrow window between smc_conn_free() zeroing
alert_token_local and smc_lgr_cleanup_early() completing smc_lgr_free().
This path fires only on early handshake abort, before the CLC handshake
completes — a window measured in microseconds.
3) use_fallback is still false. The use_fallback check at line 91
precedes the sk_state check; if fallback has already been set the reader
never reaches the guarded code.
4) The arm64 CPU speculatively executes the conn->lgr->is_smcd load
before confirming the sk_state != SMC_INIT branch. This requires two
independent speculative loads to both produce stale values: first
conn->lgr (no data dependency on sk_state prevents its speculation), and
then lgr->is_smcd off the stale pointer.

The window requires all four conditions simultaneously, the practical
risk is negligible. Rather than addressing this in isolation here, a
proper audit and READ_ONCE/smp_load_acquire annotation pass across
net/smc/ for weak-ordering correctness would be better handled as a
separate patch.

The SMC_CLOSED guard is *intentional* — needed to prevent a UAF where
smc_conn_free() has already run but the socket is still hashed.

There is also no observability regression: smcss (from the separate
smc-tools userspace repository, not part of this kernel patch) already
does goto newline on diag_state == CLOSED and never reads CONNINFO,
LGRINFO or DMBINFO for closed sockets regardless of what the kernel
sends. The rationale is currently only in the v6 changelog below ---
which gets stripped on apply. Will add it to the commit message body in v7.

You are right! I'll address this issue via a seperate patch as its a
pre-existing issue.

The smcr_link_put() in smc_switch_link_and_count() drops only the
per-connection hold taken by smc_conn_create(). The link's base refcount
(initialised to 1 in smcr_link_init()) is only released by the
smcr_link_put() at the end of smcr_link_clear(). Therefore
__smcr_link_clear() and its memset(lnk, 0) are never triggered from the
smc_switch_conns() path, and the race described in this comment is *not*
reachable.
