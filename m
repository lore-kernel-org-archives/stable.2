[ Upstream commit d16447d7470502e998d82e806ca7ed49d1baa853 ]

Some EcoNet based routers ship an on-flash EEPROM whose chip-id is
0x7592 instead of the expected 0x7603. The device probes as PCI
14c3:7603 and the hardware MT_HW_CHIPID register reports 0x7603,
independent of the EEPROM value.

This is seen across multiple EcoNet EN751221 and EN7528 based devices
(for example the Genexis Platinum 4410).

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

The evaluation target is **pending-6.6 (6.6.157)**. The mt7603 driver is
present; the 0x7592 EEPROM ID is not. This is a one-line ID addition to
an existing driver, which is a standard stable exception.

===============================================================
PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS
===============================================================

Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE
Record: [wifi: mt76: mt7603] [add] [accept EEPROM chip ID 0x7592 in
mt7603_check_eeprom]

Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS
Record:
- Signed-off-by: Ahmed Naseef \<naseefkm@gmail.com\> (author)
- Link:
  https://patch.msgid.link/20260719082530.3879831-1-naseefkm@gmail.com
- Signed-off-by: Felix Fietkau \<nbd@nbd.name\> (mt76 maintainer,
  applied the patch)
- No Fixes: tag (expected for this review queue)
- No Cc: stable (expected)
- No Reported-by / Tested-by / Reviewed-by / Acked-by
- No syzbot / KASAN tags
- Sasha Levin SOB not present on this commit

Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT
Record:
- Bug: EcoNet routers store chip-id 0x7592 in on-flash EEPROM instead of
  0x7603/0x7628/0x7600.
- Hardware identity is still MT7603: PCI 14c3:7603, and MT_HW_CHIPID
  reads 0x7603.
- Symptom: driver treats a valid factory EEPROM as invalid.
- Devices: EcoNet EN751221 and EN7528, e.g. Genexis Platinum 4410.
- No stack trace; this is hardware recognition, not a crash fix.
- Root cause: mt7603_check_eeprom() whitelist is incomplete.

Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES
Record: Not a disguised cleanup. It is an explicit EEPROM ID addition.
When the ID is rejected and OTP exists, mt7603_eeprom_init() memcpy()s
OTP over the flash EEPROM, so MAC/calibration from flash are discarded.
That is a real functional bug for those boards, not a new API.

===============================================================
PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS - LINE BY LINE
===============================================================

Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES
Record:
- File: drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7603/eeprom.c
- +1 line, 0 removed
- Function: mt7603_check_eeprom()
- Scope: single-file, one-line surgical change

Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE
Record:
- Before: switch accepts 0x7628, 0x7603, 0x7600; anything else returns
  -EINVAL.
- After: also accepts 0x7592.
- Path: probe → mt7603_register_device() → mt7603_init_hardware() →
  mt7603_eeprom_init().
- If check succeeds and OTP exists: apply cal-free OTP overlay onto
  flash EEPROM.
- If check fails and OTP exists: overwrite entire flash EEPROM with OTP
  (MAC, TX power, xtal data from flash lost).
- Probe does not fail on unknown EEPROM ID.

Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM
Record: [Hardware ID / quirk] [Whitelist used to decide whether on-flash
EEPROM is trusted. Missing 0x7592 caused valid EcoNet EEPROMs to be
discarded in favor of OTP.]

Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY
Record:
- Obviously correct: same pattern as the existing 0x7600 case.
- Minimal: one case label.
- Regression risk: very low. A random EEPROM whose first LE16 is 0x7592
  would be trusted; that is the same risk as the existing IDs.
- No API or data-structure change.

===============================================================
PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION
===============================================================

Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES
Record:
- mt7603_check_eeprom() introduced in c8846e1015022 ("mt76: add driver
  for MT7603E and MT7628/7688"), 2018, first released in v5.1-rc1.
- 0x7600 added by bf4a938ab2cf8 ("mt76: mt7603: add additional EEPROM
  chip ID"), 2020, same one-line pattern for TP-Link Archer C50 v4.
- Both commits are ancestors of pending-6.6.

Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG
Record: No Fixes: tag. Buggy whitelist dates to the original driver
(v5.1), which is in this tree.

Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES
Record:
- Related: bf4a938ab2cf8 already in 6.6 (precedent).
- Candidate d16447d747050 is not an ancestor of pending-6.6.
- Standalone; not patch X/Y.

Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS
Record:
- Author Ahmed Naseef has no other mt76 commits on pending-6.6.
- Applied by Felix Fietkau, listed maintainer of MEDIATEK MT76.

Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS
Record:
- No new helpers or struct fields.
- pending-6.6 vs patch parent only differs in SPDX and later
  chainmask/return of mt76_eeprom_override(); the switch hunk is
  identical.
- Can apply standalone with a clean hunk.

===============================================================
PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH
===============================================================

Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION
Record:
- b4 dig -c d16447d747050 →
  https://patch.msgid.link/20260719082530.3879831-1-naseefkm@gmail.com
- b4 dig -a: single v1 series, no v2/v3.
- Thread mbox is the patch only; no replies, no NAK, no Cc: stable in
  review.
- Included in wireless-next-2026-08-06 pull (Johannes Berg).
- Syzbot CI: build/boot passed; fuzz skipped.

Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH
Record:
- b4 dig -w: Felix Fietkau, Lorenzo Bianconi, Ryder Lee, Shayne Chen,
  Sean Wang, linux-wireless, linux-mediatek, linux-kernel.
- Applied by Felix Fietkau (maintainer SOB). No separate Reviewed-by.

Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT
Record:
- No bugzilla/syzbot link.
- Commit cites multiple EcoNet EN751221/EN7528 devices, example Genexis
  Platinum 4410.
- OpenWrt mt76 tree already contains case 0x7592.
- No independent public crash report found (UNVERIFIED beyond the commit
  text and OpenWrt tree).

Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES
Record: Standalone one-patch series. Same pattern as bf4a938ab2cf8.

Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY
Record: lore.kernel.org/stable returned 403. No stable discussion found
via b4/mbox. UNVERIFIED whether anyone requested/rejected this for
stable.

===============================================================
PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
===============================================================

Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS IN THE DIFF
Record: mt7603_check_eeprom() only.

Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS
Record:
- Only caller: mt7603_eeprom_init() (same file).
- mt7603_eeprom_init() ← mt7603_init_hardware() ←
  mt7603_register_device()
- mt7603_register_device() ← mt76pci_probe() (PCI 14c3:7603) and
  mt76_wmac_probe() (mediatek,mt7628-wmac).
- Probe/init path, not hot path or IRQ.

Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES
Record: get_unaligned_le16() on eeprom.data[0]. No alloc, lock, or I/O
in the changed function.

Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN
Record:
- Reachable when an MT7603 PCI device or MT7628 WMAC probes with
  CONFIG_MT7603E.
- Not a syscall-triggered memory bug; firmware/EEPROM contents decide
  the branch.
- Unprivileged users cannot trigger it except by plugging/using the
  device.

Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS
Record:
- Sibling drivers use the same EEPROM-ID switch (mt7615, mt76x0,
  mt76x2).
- This tree already backported other mt76 ID adds, e.g. efd75512e38ac
  (mt76x2u TP-Link USB ID).

===============================================================
PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE
===============================================================

Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?
Record:
- Tree under evaluation: pending-6.6, 6.6.157 (git describe
  p-6.6-3-g04810563abb71).
- Yes. pending-6.6 eeprom.c switch has 0x7628/0x7603/0x7600 only.
- git merge-base --is-ancestor d16447d747050 pending-6.6 → not present.
- Bug present since v5.1 driver introduction.

Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS
Record: Clean apply. Switch context matches. Later chainmask/license
diffs are outside the hunk.

Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE
Record: 0x7600 ID is present. 0x7592 is not. No alternate fix.

Note: EcoNet SoC support landed in 6.16 (arch/mips/econet), not in 6.6.
That lowers vanilla-6.6 user count; it does not remove the driver or the
ID check. PCI 14c3:7603 still exists in this tree.

===============================================================
PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT
===============================================================

Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY
Record: [drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7603] [IMPORTANT for
MT7603/MT7628 users; PERIPHERAL relative to core kernel]

Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY
Record: Mature driver since v5.1. 6.6 still receives mt76 fixes.
Maintainer is Felix Fietkau.

===============================================================
PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================

Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED
Record: Driver-specific / config-specific (CONFIG_MT7603E). Documented
users are EcoNet EN751221/EN7528 routers with MT7603 PCI WiFi. Vanilla
6.6 cannot boot EcoNet SoCs; downstream 6.6 kernels and any other board
with this EEPROM still benefit.

Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS
Record:
- Trigger: probe of MT7603 when flash EEPROM starts with 0x7592 and OTP
  is present.
- Every boot on those devices, not a race.
- Not exploitable by unprivileged software alone.

Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY
Record: [Wrong EEPROM source: factory MAC/calibration replaced by OTP]
[Severity: MEDIUM for those devices — broken/degraded WiFi or wrong MAC,
not oops/corruption]

Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO
Record:
- Benefit: medium for affected hardware (WiFi uses intended EEPROM);
  lower on vanilla 6.6 because EcoNet platform is later, but this is the
  usual device-ID case.
- Risk: very low (one case label, no locking/API).
- Ratio: favorable. Device-ID additions are accepted in stable for this
  reason.

===============================================================
PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS
===============================================================

Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE
FOR:
- One-line EEPROM/chip ID addition to an existing driver (stable
  exception).
- Same pattern as 0x7600, already in 6.6.
- Real boards named; hardware already binds as PCI 14c3:7603.
- Without it, valid flash EEPROM is discarded for OTP (MAC/cal).
- Maintainer applied it; applies cleanly here; no new API.
- This tree already contains similar mt76 ID backports.

AGAINST:
- Not a crash/security/deadlock.
- No Tested-by/Reviewed-by; mailing list had no discussion.
- EcoNet platform is not in 6.6, so vanilla 6.6 user count is small.
- No Fixes:/Cc: stable (expected, not a negative).

UNRESOLVED:
- Could not search lore.kernel.org/stable (403).
- No independent public repro beyond the commit and OpenWrt mt76 tree.

Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST
1. Obviously correct and tested? PASS — one-line whitelist, maintainer-
   applied, syzbot CI build/boot passed.
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? PASS — those boards trust OTP
   instead of factory EEPROM.
3. Important issue? PASS under the device-ID/quirk exception (functional
   WiFi/MAC on real hardware), even though not a panic.
4. Small and contained? PASS — +1 line, one file.
5. No new features or APIs? PASS — existing driver, additional ID only.
6. Can apply to the local tree? PASS — hunk matches pending-6.6.

Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES
Record: Device ID addition to an existing driver (EEPROM chip ID,
analogous to PCI/USB ID). Also a hardware quirk for boards whose EEPROM
ID does not match MT_HW_CHIPID.

Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION
This belongs in 6.6.y. The driver and the incomplete whitelist are in
this tree; the fix is the standard one-line ID addition stable already
takes for mt76. EcoNet SoC support arriving later reduces vanilla-6.6
exposure but does not make the patch a new feature or a dependency-heavy
backport.

What it solves for stable users: MT7603 devices whose flash EEPROM ID is
0x7592 keep factory MAC and calibration instead of having them replaced
by OTP on probe.

Risk vs benefit: essentially no regression risk; benefit is enabling
correct EEPROM use on existing hardware.

Verification:
- [Phase 1] Tags: author SOB, Felix Fietkau SOB, msgid link; no Fixes/Cc
  stable/Reported-by
- [Phase 2] Diff: +1 `case 0x7592:` in mt7603_check_eeprom()
