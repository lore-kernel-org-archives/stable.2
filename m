I don't think the forwarding case is fixable.

Host S could be another NAT gateway, so it could be possible that
the connections originate from different physical machines and
timestamps differ due to different clocks, not per-connection
randomisation.

Yes. I think the tp->tsoffset recalc is fine to handle local case.

For local case we do know that we're the end host and ts recalc is fine.

If we have some guarantee that internal network isn't doing any
snat at all, then yes, one could implement some TS adjustment
scheme similar to seqadj extension we already have to deal with
tcp sequence number adjustments.

We'd have to keep state and subtract the offset to get back the
right tsecr again on reverse direction.

I'm not keen to have something like this, it would breaks PAWS
as soon as the originating host is itself a nat gateway.

Is this really a problem to begin with?
