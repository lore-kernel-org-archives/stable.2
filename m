sctp: purge abandoned I-DATA fragments by stream and MID, not by TSN

This commit removes the TSN-based purge of the I-DATA reassembly queues
from sctp_report_iftsn(). In its place, sctp_intl_skip() frees fragments
on reasm or reasm_uo based on the stream, U bit and MID of each
I-FORWARD-TSN skip entry. The walk stops once it is past the named
stream and MID.

[Severity: Low]
Each call to sctp_intl_reasm_flush_mid() starts at the head of the queue.
It steps over every fragment of a lower-numbered stream without freeing
anything. sctp_intl_skip() now calls it once for every U-bit skip entry
(on reasm_uo) and once for every ordered entry (on reasm). Before this
patch, an I-FORWARD-TSN walked each queue only once.

sctp_validate_iftsn() only checks the stream bound, so it accepts
duplicate entries:

	sctp_walk_ifwdtsn(skip, chunk)
		if (ntohs(skip->stream) >= incnt)
			return false;

sctp_sf_eat_fwd_tsn() only discards a chunk when sctp_tsnmap_check()
returns < 0, so a chunk with an old or duplicate cumulative TSN is still
processed.

Suppose a peer keeps reasm_uo full of incomplete unordered fragments on
low streams. It then sends I-FORWARD-TSN chunks with thousands of U-bit
entries for a high sid. Could each such chunk cost O(entries x
fragments) list iterations in softirq with the socket lock held?

sctp_intl_reap_ordered() already walks the lobby this way for ordered
entries, so the pattern itself is not new. This patch adds another
instance of it.

[Severity: Medium]
With the TSN-based purge removed, what frees an unordered fragment of an
abandoned message that arrives after the I-FORWARD-TSN naming that
message has been processed?

sctp_validate_idata() accepts unordered I-DATA without any MID check:

	if (chunk->chunk_hdr->flags & SCTP_DATA_UNORDERED)
		return true;

So a late fragment with a TSN above the New Cumulative TSN is stored in
reasm_uo by sctp_intl_reasm_uo(). Its siblings were already freed by
sctp_intl_reasm_flush_mid(), so it can never be reassembled.

For example:

- Unordered message M on stream S has fragments at TSN 10 and 12. TSN 11
  belongs to another stream.
- The sender abandons M and sends I-FORWARD-TSN(cum=10, {S, U, M}).
- Fragment 12 arrives late, for example on another path.
- TSN 11 arrives, so ctsn moves to 12.
- The sender drops M from q->abandoned and does not name {S, U, M}
  again.

>From then on, the fragment is only freed by a later unordered skip on
stream S with MID >= M, by an association reset, or at teardown. Before
this patch, any later I-FORWARD-TSN covering its TSN would have freed it.

While it stays queued, it keeps its sctp_assoc_rwnd_decrease() charge,
its rmem charges, and the association reference taken in
sctp_ulpevent_receive_data(). sctp_ulpq_renege_list() won't reclaim it
either:

	if (TSN_lte(tsn, sctp_tsnmap_get_ctsn(tsnmap)))
		break;

Renege walks from the tail. If a stuck fragment sits at the tail of
reasm_uo, it also blocks reneging of every other reasm_uo entry.

The commit message says:

  "Fragments that no skip entry names, such as a late copy of an
  abandoned fragment, are no longer freed by an unrelated I-FORWARD-TSN;
  they stay until the association is freed."

Should the commit message also mention the lost rwnd and receive buffer
space? Alternatively, could these fragments be dropped when they arrive,
or when the cumulative TSN moves past them?

>  	/* abort only when it's for all data */
>  	if (ftsn == sctp_tsnmap_get_max_tsn_seen(&ulpq->asoc->peer.tsn_map))
>  		sctp_intl_abort_pd(ulpq, GFP_ATOMIC);

[Severity: High]
Can this branch still flush the whole ulpq for an ordinary I-FORWARD-TSN?

Just above, sctp_tsnmap_skip() raises max_tsn_seen to ftsn whenever
ftsn is higher:

	if (TSN_lt(map->max_tsn_seen, tsn))
		map->max_tsn_seen = tsn;

So the equality holds whenever the New Cumulative TSN is at or above the
highest TSN received. That happens, for example, when the abandoned
message was the last one sent, or when later data is still in flight.

sctp_intl_abort_pd() then aborts partial delivery on every stream. It
also frees everything in reasm, reasm_uo and lobby, whatever the stream
or MID:

	/* intl abort pd happens only when all data needs to be cleaned */
	sctp_ulpq_flush(ulpq);

sctp_sf_eat_fwd_tsn() queues SCTP_CMD_REPORT_FWDTSN before
SCTP_CMD_PROCESS_FWDTSN. So this flush also runs before the new per-MID
handling in sctp_intl_skip().

Wouldn't this still free the already-acked fragments of an in-progress
message on another stream? That is the loss this patch sets out to fix.
The commit message describes this branch only in terms of the reset
paths:

  "The association reset paths that also call sctp_report_iftsn() are
  not affected: they pass the highest TSN seen, so sctp_intl_abort_pd()
  still flushes the whole ulpq for them."

A later patch in this series, "sctp: don't treat an I-FORWARD-TSN as an
association reset", seems to address this. It drops the max_tsn_seen
check from sctp_report_iftsn() and makes the stream reset paths call
si->abort_pd() directly. This patch is tagged for stable on its own.
Should that change be folded in here, or should the two be backported
together?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch. Does the
new flush leave unordered partial delivery stuck when the skipped MID is
the message currently being partially delivered?

The check just above in sctp_intl_skip() uses a strict comparison:

	if (sin->pd_mode_uo && MID_lt(sin->mid_uo, mid)) {

When mid == sin->mid_uo, pd_mode_uo stays set and no
SCTP_PARTIAL_DELIVERY_ABORTED event is queued.
sctp_intl_reasm_flush_mid() then frees all remaining fragments of that
MID, because it only stops on MID_lt(mid, event->mid).

The stream is left in unordered partial delivery with nothing left to
deliver. sctp_intl_retrieve_first_uo() and
sctp_intl_retrieve_reassembled_uo() skip that stream, and the
application never gets the abort notification.

The strict comparison comes from the original code. The next patch in
this series, "sctp: abort unordered partial delivery when its message is
skipped", changes it to !MID_lt(mid, sin->mid_uo).
