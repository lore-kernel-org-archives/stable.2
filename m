	Although the review is for v4 and there is also v5,
some of the concerns are still valid and we should post
v6 to fix the problems. I'll answer the questions below...

	I'll change the title and the text to be more precise.

	This race needs a separate solution.

	As the n_control reference is secondary, we can simply crash
if not checking for n_control after refcount_dec_if_one()

	Yes, we already have refcount_set(&cp->refcnt, 1) in v5
instead of refcount_inc(), I overlooked the problem with the
saturation in v4.

	Yep, I'll add smp_acquire__after_ctrl_dep() in v6
