xfs_fs_map_blocks() marks the inode XFS_DIFLAG_PREALLOC after it
allocates blocks for a write layout, so that xfs_free_eofblocks() does
not free blocks past EOF that a client may write to. But a write layout
for a range past EOF where blocks are already allocated, such as the
speculative preallocation of buffered writes, gets those blocks without
an allocation, and the inode is not marked. blockgc, or the release of
the file, then frees them without breaking the layout. The client still
writes to them, and they may belong to another file by then.

With pynfs as the client, a file grown to 1 MiB by two buffered writes
on the server had 960 KiB preallocated past EOF, and an RW LAYOUTGET for
that range got it as one INVALID_DATA extent, without the inode being
marked. About 300 seconds later, with the default
speculative_prealloc_lifetime, blockgc freed those blocks while the
layout was still held. When the client then wrote through the layout and
sent LAYOUTCOMMIT, xfs_fs_commit_blocks() found a hole where the
unwritten extent had been, and xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() allocated for
it with no blocks reserved:

  XFS (nvme0n1): Corruption of in-memory data (0x8) detected at
    xfs_trans_mod_sb+0x817/0x960 (fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c:351).
    Shutting down filesystem.
  ...

   nfsd4_block_proc_layoutcommit+0x5c2/0x7d0
   nfsd4_layoutcommit+0x4b5/0xa20

The client got NFS4ERR_IO, in six runs out of six. When small files were
written on the server after blockgc, with a sync first so that the freed
extents were no longer busy, they got those blocks, and the client's
write through the layout replaced 978944 bytes of their data before the
LAYOUTCOMMIT. A LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTCOMMIT 30 seconds apart, before
blockgc runs, leave the client's data in place.

Mark the inode also when a write mapping ends past EOF and nothing was
allocated, the same way as for an allocation, before the blocks are
handed out. With this, the same test keeps the blocks past blockgc, and
the LAYOUTCOMMIT after 360 seconds succeeds with the data in place.

Tested with this patch on nfsd-testing (3af417ce0f30), where xfs_pnfs.c
differs from xfs for-next only by commit e3c682dd1130 ("xfs: map pNFS
layouts to the end of the extent again"), with KASAN and lockdep, XFS on
an NVMe/TCP namespace shared by the server and the client:

- the reproducer above (a local pynfs test, not posted);
- pynfs block, blockextent and a local multi-extent test, 2 runs: 15
  pass, BLOCK3 fails with NFS4ERR_BADXDR for its empty layoutupdate, as
  without this patch;
- fstests generic/075, 091 and 263 with the Linux client over the block
  layout: only 075 fails, as without this patch.

Chuck pointed this out in the review of the ->map_blocks series, whose
patch 7 will carry the same check for all mappings of a call:
