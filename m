[ Upstream commit c236563c8a84239d31a1e6ec4444887a7b5ed98f ]

i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() no longer leaves the address marked as
free on failure, so aborting the DAA sequence on its error is unnecessary.

Failure to register a discovered device does not invalidate the entire
Dynamic Address Assignment (DAA) procedure.  Align with the behavior of
other I3C master drivers by ignoring errors from
i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() and continuing enumeration.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit Message Forensics

### Step 1.1: Subject Line
**Record:** `[i3c: mipi-i3c-hci]` `[Tolerate]` — Stop aborting DAA when
`i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` fails; continue enumeration instead.

### Step 1.2: Tags
**Record:**
- **Signed-off-by:** Adrian Hunter `<adrian.hunter@intel.com>` (author)
- **Reviewed-by:** Frank Li `<Frank.Li@nxp.com>` (NXP I3C maintainer)
- **Link:** https://patch.msgid.link/20260612080107.11606-5-
  adrian.hunter@intel.com
- **Signed-off-by:** Alexandre Belloni `<alexandre.belloni@bootlin.com>`
  (I3C subsystem maintainer)
- No Fixes:, Reported-by:, Tested-by:, Cc: stable, or syzbot tags
- Notable: Reviewed by subsystem expert; part of V4 4/7 series

### Step 1.3: Body Analysis
**Record:**
- **Bug:** `mipi-i3c-hci` aborts the entire DAA loop when
  `i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` fails for one device.
- **Symptom:** Remaining I3C devices on the bus are never
  enumerated/registered after a single device-add failure.
- **Root cause (per author):** After commit `38d3d33` ("Prevent reuse of
  dynamic address on device add failure"), failed registration no longer
  frees the address slot, so aborting DAA is unnecessary and harmful.
- **Fix approach:** Ignore the return value and continue DAA, matching
  `svc-i3c-master`, `cdns`, `renesas`, `dw`, and `adi` drivers.
- No explicit kernel version range in message.

### Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection
**Record:** Yes — described as alignment/cleanup, but it fixes a real
logic bug: premature DAA termination leaves devices undiscovered. Same
class of bug fixed in `svc-i3c-master` (commit `3b2ac810`, Cc: stable).

---

## Phase 2: Diff Analysis

### Step 2.1: Inventory
**Record:**
- `drivers/i3c/master/mipi-i3c-hci/cmd_v1.c`: −3 lines (remove ret check
  + break)
- `drivers/i3c/master/mipi-i3c-hci/cmd_v2.c`: −3 lines (same)
- Functions: `hci_cmd_v1_daa()`, `hci_cmd_v2_daa()`
- Scope: single-file surgical fix in one driver (2 command variants)

### Step 2.2: Code Flow Change
**Record:**
- **Hunk 1 (`cmd_v1.c`):** Before: assign address via hardware DAA →
  call `i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` → on error, `break` out of DAA
  loop. After: call function without checking return; loop continues to
  next device.
- **Hunk 2 (`cmd_v2.c`):** Identical behavioral change in v2 DAA path.
- Affected path: normal DAA enumeration loop during bus probe / hot-
  join.

### Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism
**Record:**
- **Category:** Logic/correctness fix (error-path handling)
- **Mechanism:** Treating a per-device registration failure as fatal to
  the entire multi-device DAA sequence. With prerequisite `38d3d33`, the
  address is retained on failure, so continuing is safe. Aborting
  prevents registration of subsequently discovered devices.

### Step 2.4: Fix Quality
**Record:** Obviously correct — matches established pattern in five
other I3C master drivers. Minimal change. Low regression risk: only
removes an overly aggressive early-exit; real bus/transfer errors still
break the loop via `RESP_STATUS` checks.

---

## Phase 3: Git History Investigation

### Step 3.1: Blame
**Record:** Buggy `if (ret) break;` pattern introduced in
`9ad9a52cce282` (Nov 2020, "i3c/master: introduce the mipi-i3c-hci
driver"). Present since driver introduction.

### Step 3.2: Fixes: Tag
**Record:** N/A — no Fixes: tag. Prerequisite identified from commit
message: `38d3d33bf42c2` / upstream `b3ba8383da4d0` ("Prevent reuse of
dynamic address on device add failure"), which changes
`i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` to mark addresses as occupied on
failure via `err_prevent_addr_reuse`. **Confirmed present in this tree**
(`git merge-base --is-ancestor` passes).

### Step 3.3: Related File History
**Record:** Recent related commits in tree:
- `38d3d33` — prerequisite (already backported to 6.18.y)
- `3b2ac810` — svc driver: identical "don't check return value" fix (in
  tree, Cc: stable)
- Fix commit `c236563c8a842` is in mainline but **not yet in this
  6.18.44 checkout**

### Step 3.4: Author Context
**Record:** Adrian Hunter is an active Intel I3C contributor. Multiple
related fixes in `drivers/i3c/` around DAA, hot-join, and address
management (Jun 2026 series).

### Step 3.5: Dependencies
**Record:**
- **Hard dependency:** `38d3d33` (already in tree) — without it,
  continuing DAA after failure could reassign addresses.
- **Not required:** Patches 1/7 (race fix), 2/7 (DISEC), 5–7/7 (return-
  void API change + reconciliation — **not merged to mainline**).
- **Standalone:** Yes, for stable purposes, given prerequisite is
  present.

---

## Phase 4: Mailing List and External Research

### Step 4.1: Original Discussion
**Record:**
- **URL:** https://patch.msgid.link/20260612080107.11606-5-
  adrian.hunter@intel.com
- **Series:** V1→V4, patch 4/7; applied version is latest (V4)
- **Cover letter (V4 0/7):** "Patches 3-7 fix address management
  issues... when DAA does not complete cleanly"
- **Reviewer feedback:** "Applied, thanks!" from maintainer on cover
  letter
- No explicit stable nomination found in mbox for this specific patch

### Step 4.2: Reviewers
**Record:** CC'd: `alexandre.belloni@bootlin.com`, `Frank.Li@nxp.com`,
`linux-i3c@lists.infradead.org`, `linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org`.
Reviewed-by Frank Li (NXP).

### Step 4.3: Bug Report
**Record:** No external bug report or syzbot link. Bug identified
through code review / series development. Precedent: `3b2ac810`
documented identical failure mode for svc driver with explicit I3C spec
violation scenario.

### Step 4.4: Related Patches
**Record:** Part of 7-patch V4 series. Patches 5–7 (API change to void
return + post-DAA reconciliation) were **not** merged upstream. This
patch was merged standalone with patch 3.

### Step 4.5: Stable List History
**Record:** No stable-list discussion found for this specific patch.
Prerequisite `38d3d33` was backported to this tree (has upstream-commit
marker and Greg K commit).

---

## Phase 5: Code Semantic Analysis

### Step 5.1: Key Functions
**Record:** `hci_cmd_v1_daa()`, `hci_cmd_v2_daa()`, called via
`i3c_hci_daa()` in `core.c`.

### Step 5.2: Callers
**Record:** `i3c_hci_daa()` → registered as `master->ops.do_daa` →
invoked by `i3c_master_do_daa()` / `i3c_master_do_daa_ext()` during bus
initialization and hot-join DAA. Called during device probe, not a hot
syscall path.

### Step 5.3: Callees
**Record:** `i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` — allocates device,
retrieves CCC info, attaches to bus. On failure (with `38d3d33`): logs
error, marks address slot occupied, returns error code.

### Step 5.4: Reachability
**Record:** Triggered during I3C bus enumeration on systems using
`mipi-i3c-hci` (Intel and other MIPI HCI platforms). Multi-device buses
are common (sensors, PMICs, etc.). Failure of one device's registration
is plausible (transient CCC errors, firmware quirks).

### Step 5.5: Similar Patterns
**Record:** All other I3C master drivers ignore
`i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` return during DAA:

```1224:1225:drivers/i3c/master/svc-i3c-master.c
        for (i = 0; i < dev_nb; i++)
                i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked(m, addrs[i]);
```

Same pattern in `renesas-i3c.c`, `i3c-master-cdns.c`, `dw-i3c-master.c`,
`adi-i3c-master.c`. `mipi-i3c-hci` is the only outlier.

---

## Phase 6: Cross-Reference Against Local Tree

### Step 6.1: Buggy Code Exists?
**Record:** **Yes.** Local tree is **linux-6.18.y** (`v6.18.44`). Both
`cmd_v1.c:365-367` and `cmd_v2.c:303-305` still have `ret =
i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked(...); if (ret) break;`. Bug present since
driver introduction (2020).

### Step 6.2: Backport Complications
**Record:** **Clean apply.** `git cherry-pick --no-commit c236563c8a842`
auto-merged both files without conflicts.

### Step 6.3: Related Fixes Already Present?
**Record:**
- Prerequisite `38d3d33` — **present**
- Svc driver equivalent fix `3b2ac810` — **present**
- This specific mipi-i3c-hci fix — **not present**

---

## Phase 7: Subsystem and Maintainer Context

### Step 7.1: Subsystem Criticality
**Record:** `drivers/i3c/master/mipi-i3c-hci/` — **IMPORTANT** (bus
driver affecting all I3C peripherals on HCI-based platforms, but
hardware-specific).

### Step 7.2: Subsystem Activity
**Record:** Actively maintained — multiple mipi-i3c-hci fixes in 6.18.y
(hot-join, DMA, IRQ handling).

---

## Phase 8: Impact and Risk Assessment

### Step 8.1: Who Is Affected
**Record:** Users of `CONFIG_I3C` with `mipi-i3c-hci` hardware and
multiple I3C devices on the bus.

### Step 8.2: Trigger Conditions
**Record:** DAA discovers ≥2 devices; `i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()`
fails for an early device (allocation failure, CCC retrieval error,
duplicate handling, etc.). Not timing-dependent. Requires `CONFIG_I3C` +
mipi-i3c-hci. Unprivileged users cannot directly trigger, but affects
system hardware functionality at boot/probe.

### Step 8.3: Failure Mode Severity
**Record:** Subsequent I3C devices fail to register —
sensors/peripherals missing, potential bus state inconsistency (hardware
has address assigned, kernel unaware). **Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH** for
affected hardware (functional failure, not kernel crash). Pre-`38d3d33`,
could also cause address conflicts on hot-join (documented in svc fix);
that part is fixed, but partial enumeration remains.

### Step 8.4: Risk-Benefit
**Record:**
- **Benefit:** HIGH for affected platforms — restores multi-device
  enumeration; completes behavior change started by `38d3d33` backport
- **Risk:** VERY LOW — 6-line total removal, matches five other drivers,
  prerequisite already in tree
- **Ratio:** Strong benefit, minimal risk

---

## Phase 9: Final Synthesis

### Step 9.1: Evidence Summary

**FOR backport:**
- Real functional bug with documented precedent (`3b2ac810`, Cc: stable)
- Prerequisite `38d3d33` already in 6.18.y
- Surgical 6-line fix, reviewed by NXP maintainer
- Applies cleanly
- Aligns mipi-i3c-hci with all other I3C master drivers
- Completes address-management fix series partially backported to stable

**AGAINST backport:**
- No crash, security issue, or data corruption
- Hardware-specific (mipi-i3c-hci only)
- Requires `i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` failure (not everyday, but
  plausible)
- Part of larger series (but this patch is self-contained with
  prerequisite)

**Unresolved:** No user bug report or syzbot reproduction; impact
inferred from code analysis and svc-driver precedent.

### Step 9.2: Stable Rules Checklist
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — matches established driver
   pattern; Reviewed-by Frank Li
2. Fixes a real bug? **PASS** — premature DAA abort leaves devices
   undiscovered
3. Important issue? **PASS** — functional hardware failure on multi-
   device I3C buses (MEDIUM-HIGH for affected users)
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — 2 files, 6 lines removed
5. No new features/APIs? **PASS** — behavior alignment only
6. Can apply to local tree? **PASS** — clean cherry-pick; prerequisite
   present

### Step 9.3: Exception Categories
**Record:** N/A — not a device ID, quirk, DT, build, or docs fix.
Standard driver bug fix.

### Step 9.4: Decision Rationale
This fix should be backported to **linux-6.18.y** because the
prerequisite commit changing `i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked()` failure
semantics is already in the tree, but `mipi-i3c-hci` still aborts DAA on
registration failure — leaving subsequent devices undiscovered. The
identical issue was fixed and stable-nominated for the svc driver. This
is the companion fix for the HCI driver, small and low-risk.
