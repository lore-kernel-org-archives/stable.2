6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 3f5dc09141a7bfe286620a6869d1d70ffe32d6b8 ]

Section 5f still describes the rule propagate_umount() used before
commit f0d0ba19985d ("Rewrite of propagate_umount()"). It states that a
mount that receives the unmount by propagation is left alone as soon as
it has any submount. That's not true anymore.

A propagated unmount unmounts a mount with sub-mounts as long as every
sub-mount gets unmounted together with it. This is the case when the
sub-mounts are unmounted by the same propagation. Only a sub-mount that
cannot be unmounted keeps its parent mounted.

The section also only describes a single mount without sub-mounts. But
lazy unmounts take a tree and every mount of the tree propagates its
unmount from its parent mount.
