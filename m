[ Upstream commit 6f083fbccd5f06889bc08e1182bd02c0383b9121 ]

A sigtrap event must also set remove_on_exec, so that its SIGTRAP never
reaches a program after exec. But the signal is sent from task work,
which only runs on the way back to user space. If the event overflows
shortly before execve(), the task work can still be pending when the
task enters execve(), and then runs when execve() returns. By then
perf_event_exec() has removed the event and the new program has default
signal handlers, so the SIGTRAP kills it.

The exec_stress test in the remove_on_exec selftest catches this and
fails about half the time in a VM. A process that opens a sigtrap event
on itself and then calls execve() is killed by SIGTRAP in 15% to 50% of
runs, both on an AMD machine running v7.2 and in a VM, with or without
close-on-exec on the event fd.

Commit ffb684f2aa14 ("perf: Fix race between perf_event_exit_task() and
perf_pending_task()") made perf_sigtrap() return once
perf_event_exit_task() has set ctx->task to TASK_TOMBSTONE. Exec only
calls perf_event_exit_task() when the new program is not dumpable, such
as a setuid one. An ordinary exec keeps the context and only removes the
remove_on_exec events, so the SIGTRAP is still sent.

perf_event_exit_event() sets PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT when exec removes the
event. If the event fd is close-on-exec and was the last reference to
the file, exec also queues the file release as task work. Task work runs
newest first, so perf_release() runs before the SIGTRAP work and moves
the event on to PERF_EVENT_STATE_DEAD. So don't send the signal when the
event state is PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT or lower, which means the event has
been removed. That also covers PERF_EVENT_STATE_REVOKED, where the PMU
is gone.
