6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 1f978881ce6c9ac4f4d4a7b6a6e52339eadcd350 ]

zap_process() skips every thread that already has PF_POSTCOREDUMP set.
Such a thread is past synchronize_group_exit(), so a coredump can't
catch it anymore. It isn't counted in core_state->threads_remaining and
it isn't sent SIGKILL.

do_exit() sets PF_POSTCOREDUMP in synchronize_group_exit() and calls
io_uring_files_cancel() right after that. The cancellation runs task
work and a create_worker_cb() that io-wq queued before the exit creates
a new io-wq worker from there. If another thread started a coredump in
the meantime that worker joins a thread-group which is already being
dumped. zap_process() never saw it so it was never counted. But when it
exits it sees signal->core_state in synchronize_group_exit() and
decrements threads_remaining like any other thread.

So the count reaches zero one thread early and the dumper leaves
coredump_wait_inactive() while a thread it counted is still running.

The task has no fatal signal pending because zap_process() deliberately
didn't send it one, and it never went through get_signal() so it doesn't
have PF_SIGNALED either.

Refuse to create an io thread when the creator has PF_POSTCOREDUMP.
That costs nothing. io_uring_files_cancel() raises IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT
before it runs any task work, so a worker created from there only ever
gets to exit again, and io_should_retry_thread() doesn't retry -EINTR.

Clearing PF_POSTCOREDUMP for the new thread in copy_process() was the
other option. It makes the worker a thread like any other, but it only
helps while the dump hasn't started. A worker born after zap_process()
has run is invisible to it whatever its flags say and still decrements
threads_remaining on the way out. Refusing to create it covers both, and
then no task is ever born with the flag, so there is nothing to clear.

Moving io_uring_files_cancel() ahead of synchronize_group_exit() closes
the same window. It runs the cancellation, and whatever that can block
on, before the thread announces itself to the dumper. A thread that
blocks there never reaches coredump_task_exit() at all, so the dumper
ends up waiting for a thread that never parks. Refusing the creation
leaves the cancellation where it is. But it's very ugly to run io_uring
work even before we did all the generic exit work.
