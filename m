6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@kernel.org>

commit c5f0bc9fd1cec4a00400cc727fcde03e0fde17cc upstream.

The check for private futexes whether the waiter's mm, which is stored in
the futex_key and copied into the pi_state, is the same as the owner's mm
is not sufficient for exec(). exec() has a gap where the mm check fails to
give the correct answer:

  exec()
  ...
    exec_release_mm()
      futex_exec_release()
        tsk::futex::exit_state = EXITING;
        cleanup_robust_list();
1)      tsk::futex::exit_state = OK;
    ...
    old_mm = tsk::mm;
2)  tsk::mm = ->mm;

Between #1 and #2 the check for the mm is wrong as that mm is about to be
swapped out and eventually freed.

Plug this gap by:

  1) Setting tsk::futex::exit_state to FUTEX_STATE_DEAD in
     futex_exec_release()

  2) Setting tsk::futex::exit_state to FUTEX_STATE_OK after
     the mm has been switched.

>>From a futex point of view the task is dead after it finished the robust
list cleanup up to the point where it sets the state to OK again.
