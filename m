s390/ctcm: Fix use-after-free in channel_remove()

The patch changes channel_remove() so that it no longer calls
fsm_deltimer(). It calls timer_delete_sync() and timer_shutdown_sync() on
the underlying timer_list instead. It also moves the MPC tasklet_kill()
calls and kfree(ch->discontact_th) ahead of kfree_fsm(ch->fsm). The aim is
to stop timer and tasklet callbacks from running against freed channel
memory.

Link: https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260803182736.2356374-1-nagamani@linux.ibm.com?part=1

> Patch 1 changes fsm_addtimer() to use mod_timer() without reinitializing
> the timer, which is required for timer_shutdown_sync() to reliably
> prevent subsequent re-arms.
>
> Backporting patch 2 without patch 1 is not safe because the old
> fsm_addtimer() reinitializes the timer with timer_setup() before
> add_timer().

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but "Patch 1" and "patch 2" won't mean anything once
these commits are in git history.

The prerequisite is "s390/ctcm: Fix timer corruption in fsm_addtimer()".
Its Fixes: tag (e99e88a9d2b0) is different from the one on this commit
(293d984f0e36). Without it, fsm_addtimer() calls timer_setup() again, which
restores ->function and undoes timer_shutdown_sync(&ch->sweep_timer.tl).

Could the commit message name the prerequisite by title or SHA? Could the
Cc: stable line also use the "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # <ver>: <sha>:
<title>" form, so the dependency is recorded in a way tools can pick up?

[Severity: High]
Is this quiesce early enough? On the offline path, channel_remove() only
runs after ctcm_free_netdevice() has already freed the shared MPC state:

ctcm_shutdown_device()
    channel_free(priv->channel[CTCM_READ])
    channel_free(priv->channel[CTCM_WRITE])
    unregister_netdev(dev)
    ctcm_free_netdevice(dev)
        kfree_fsm(grp->fsm)
        kfree(grp)
        priv->mpcg = NULL
        kfree_fsm(priv->fsm)
        free_netdev(dev)        /* MODULE builds only */
    ...
    channel_remove(priv->channel[CTCM_READ])
    channel_remove(priv->channel[CTCM_WRITE])

ctcmpc_bh(), the ch_tasklet handler, dereferences these objects without
checking the channel FSM state. Setting CTC_STATE_IDLE in channel_free()
therefore doesn't stop a tasklet that is already pending:

drivers/s390/net/ctcm_mpc.c:ctcmpc_bh() {
	struct net_device *dev	= ch->netdev;
	struct ctcm_priv  *priv	= dev->ml_priv;
	struct mpc_group  *grp	= priv->mpcg;
    ...
	while ((fsm_getstate(grp->fsm) != MPCG_STATE_FLOWC) &&
    ...
}

Suppose the RX path scheduled rch->ch_tasklet just before the device was
taken offline, and the tasklet is still pending (for example deferred to
ksoftirqd) when ctcm_free_netdevice() runs. Can it then dereference a NULL
priv->mpcg, or a freed dev in MODULE builds, before channel_remove() gets
to tasklet_kill()?

Something similar can happen with sweep_timer. An in-flight action in
ctcmpc_chx_send_sweep() can overwrite the CTC_STATE_IDLE set by
channel_free() and re-arm wch->timer:

	fsm_addtimer(&wch->timer, CTCM_TIME_5_SEC, CTC_EVENT_TIMER, wch);
	fsm_newstate(wch->fsm, CTC_STATE_TX);

If that timer fires before channel_remove(), the TX timer action would use
ch->netdev and priv->mpcg, which by then are freed or NULL.

The error path in ctcm_new_device() has the same order: it calls
ctcm_free_netdevice() at out_dev and channel_remove() on both channels
afterwards.

Would it make sense to quiesce the tasklets and timers of both channels
before ctcm_free_netdevice() is called?

[Severity: Medium]
Can a timer callback schedule ch_disc_tasklet again after the
tasklet_kill() above?

tasklet_kill() waits for the current run and clears TASKLET_STATE_SCHED.
It doesn't stop a later tasklet_hi_schedule(), and the timer actions can
reach one. ctcmpc_chx_send_sweep() raises MPCG_EVENT_INOP when
set_normalized_cda() fails:

	if (set_normalized_cda(&wch->ccw[4], skb->data)) {
		...
		fsm_event(grp->fsm, MPCG_EVENT_INOP, dev);

CTC_EVENT_TIMER actions such as ctcm_chx_txretry() can also end up raising
MPCG_EVENT_INOP. mpc_action_go_inop() then does:

	case MPCG_STATE_FLOWC:
	case MPCG_STATE_READY:
	default:
		tasklet_hi_schedule(&wch->ch_disc_tasklet);

Consider a timer action that read a non-IDLE state before channel_free()
and is still running across the tasklet_kill() calls.
timer_shutdown_sync() and timer_delete_sync() wait for that callback, but
not for the tasklet it queued. mpc_action_send_discontact() would then run
on the freed ch and start I/O through ccw[15]. add_channel() pointed
ccw[15].cda at the discontact_th buffer, which is freed just above.

On the ctcm_shutdown_device() path, the same callback would also touch the
grp->fsm that ctcm_free_netdevice() has already freed. The window is
narrow, but nothing blocks the reschedule.

Would a second tasklet_kill() after the timers are synced, or a
tasklet_disable() before them, close this?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the same removal sequence
seems to leave two other FSM timers running on freed memory.

ctcmpc_init_mpc_group() binds grp->timer, which is embedded in grp, with
fsm_settimer(grp->fsm, &grp->timer). ctcm_init_netdevice() binds
priv->restart_timer to priv->fsm. ctcm_free_netdevice() frees all of these
without first cancelling either timer synchronously:

drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:ctcm_free_netdevice() {
    ...
		if (grp) {
			if (grp->fsm)
				kfree_fsm(grp->fsm);
			...
			kfree(grp);
			priv->mpcg = NULL;
		}
		if (priv->fsm) {
			kfree_fsm(priv->fsm);
			priv->fsm = NULL;
		}
    ...
}

priv, which embeds restart_timer, is freed later in ctcm_remove_device().

For MPC devices ctcm_close() does nothing, so no FSM event stops these
timers during ctcm_shutdown_device(). grp->timer is armed for
MPC_XID_TIMEOUT_VALUE during XID negotiation. restart_timer is armed for
500 ms by mpc_action_go_inop() and for 1 s by dev_action_restart(). With
port_persist == 1 and an unreachable peer, restart_timer keeps cycling.

If the MPC device is taken offline while either timer is pending,
fsm_expire_timer() would call fsm_event(this->fi, ...) on a freed
fsm_instance. For grp->timer, the timer_list itself also lives in freed
memory, which can corrupt the timer wheel. In MODULE builds the dev event
argument has been freed by free_netdev() as well.

Should grp->timer and priv->restart_timer be stopped with
timer_delete_sync() or timer_shutdown_sync() before ctcm_free_netdevice()
frees them?
