6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Yosry Ahmed <yosry@kernel.org>

commit 05a0b701d1089fb57beeb8982f23c3bbafe0fa8b upstream.

KVM services local TLB flushes on "full" nested VM-Exits (through
__nested_vmx_vmexit()), but not if a nested VM-Enter fails (e.g. due to
failed VMCS checks in nested_vmx_enter_non_root_mode()).

However, it is possible that KVM had queued TLB flushes that need to be
performed, even if the nested VM-Enter was not successful. For example,
if VPID is disabled for L2 (via nested_vmx_transition_tlb_flush(), or if
via the MSR load lists, as the SDM says:

  If any MSR is being loaded in such a way that would architecturally
  require a TLB flush, the TLBs are updated so that, after VM entry, the
  logical processor will not use any translations that were cached before
  the transition.

The SDM is unclear about when the TLB flush should occur, and whether or
not a failed VM entry would flush the TLB, so it is safer to always
do the TLB flush in this case.

More concretely, KVM also updates the last VPID L1 used for L2 in
nested_vmx_transition_tlb_flush() (i.e. last_vpid), even if the VM entry
ultimately fails. With the current code, KVM could miss a TLB flush if
L1 changes L2's VPID, then does a failed VM entry followed by a
successful one, as the failed VM entry would update last_vpid but not
actually flush the TLB. Servicing local TLB flushes on failed VM entries
makes sure that the TLB is always flushed when last_vpid is updated.
