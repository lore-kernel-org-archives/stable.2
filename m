__kvm_rmap_lock() deliberately elides the rmap lock when it observes an
empty rmap.  In that case kvm_rmap_lock_readonly() also re-enables
preemption and returns zero, so the caller holds neither the rmap lock
nor a preemption reference.  The elision documents the invariant it
relies on:

	 * Elide the lock if the rmap is empty, as lockless walkers (read-only
	 * mode) don't need to (and can't) walk an empty rmap, nor can they add
	 * entries to the rmap.  I.e. the only paths that process empty rmaps
	 * do so while holding mmu_lock for write, and are mutually exclusive.

kvm_rmap_age_gfn_range() ignores the returned value and unconditionally
enters for_each_rmap_spte_lockless().  The iterator starts with
rmap_get_first(), which re-reads rmap_head->val rather than using the
value returned by the lock.  If a writer populates the rmap between the
lock's read and the iterator's re-read, the aging path walks the newly
installed rmap without holding its lock.

For a KVM_RMAP_MANY rmap this leaves the walker following a
pte_list_desc chain that it never locked.  A writer holding mmu_lock for
write may free that chain (e.g. kvm_zap_all_rmap_sptes() on the recycle
path, or any rmap zap) via kmem_cache_free() while the walk is in
progress, giving a slab use-after-free.  Nothing serialises the two: the
aging path runs without mmu_lock when CONFIG_KVM_MMU_LOCKLESS_AGING=y,
and the rmap lock that would otherwise exclude the writer was elided.
Because the empty path re-enables preemption, the interval between the
two reads can span an arbitrary scheduling delay.

Skip the walk when locking returned zero, as required by the
lock-elision invariant.  kvm_rmap_unlock_readonly() already treats zero
as requiring no unlock, so the early continue does not leak a lock or a
preemption reference.  Missing an SPTE installed after the empty
observation is harmless because aging is best-effort.

This bug was identified and confirmed with AI assistance; per
Documentation/process/security-bugs.rst it is therefore reported in the
open rather than via the security list.

The static analysis and runtime evidence are described separately.

Static: the invariant quoted above is stated by __kvm_rmap_lock(), and
kvm_rmap_age_gfn_range() is the one caller that violates it by walking
after an elided (zero) lock.  This holds regardless of any runtime
result.

Runtime: I confirmed the use-after-free is reachable on a KASAN build
(CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC=y, CONFIG_KVM_MMU_LOCKLESS_AGING=y, kvm.tdp_mmu=0,
kvm_intel.ept=0 so shared pages build multi-SPTE pte_list_desc rmaps).
This is not a natural reproducer: it is a test-only race amplifier.  A
test hook widens two windows (a delay after the zero-lock observation,
and a delay after the iterator has cached iter->desc) and schedules the
real lockless aging function onto recently recycled gfns.  The alloc and
free are unmodified production paths; only the scheduling of the aging
walk and the two delays are injected.  The test-only instrumentation is
available privately on request.  KASAN then reports a
slab-use-after-free, read in the rmap_get_next() step of
for_each_rmap_spte_lockless() (the symbol is
kvm_rmap_age_gfn_range.isra.0 in the instrumented build):

  The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff88814690c6c0
   which belongs to the cache pte_list_desc of size 128

The three tasks are distinct (read 81966 / alloc 94096 / free 94095),
confirming genuine concurrency rather than a self-inflicted free.  With
the fix applied under the same injection load, the zero -> populated
window is still observed but the walk is skipped and no KASAN report is
produced.

Alternative fix: this patch fixes the only current caller that ignores
an empty return.  A class-wide alternative would pass the value returned
by kvm_rmap_lock_readonly() into the iterator instead of having
rmap_get_first() re-read the rmap, so no lockless walker could
reintroduce the bug.  I chose the smaller change for ease of
backporting, and can send the larger one if preferred.
