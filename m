xfs_fs_map_blocks() marks the inode XFS_DIFLAG_PREALLOC after it
allocates blocks for a write layout, so that xfs_free_eofblocks() does
not free blocks past EOF that a client may write to. But a write layout
for a range past EOF where blocks are already allocated, such as the
speculative preallocation of buffered writes, gets those blocks without
an allocation, and the inode is not marked. blockgc, or the release of
the file, then frees them without breaking the layout. The client still
writes to them, and they may belong to another file by then.

With pynfs as the client, a file grown to 1 MiB by two buffered writes
on the server had 960 KiB preallocated past EOF, and an RW LAYOUTGET for
that range got it as one INVALID_DATA extent, without the inode being
marked. About 300 seconds later, with the default
speculative_prealloc_lifetime, blockgc freed those blocks while the
layout was still held. When the client then wrote through the layout and
sent LAYOUTCOMMIT, xfs_fs_commit_blocks() found a hole where the
unwritten extent had been, and xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() allocated for
it with no blocks reserved:

  XFS (nvme0n1): Corruption of in-memory data (0x8) detected at
    xfs_trans_mod_sb+0x817/0x960 (fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c:351).
    Shutting down filesystem.
  ...

   nfsd4_block_proc_layoutcommit+0x5c2/0x7d0
   nfsd4_layoutcommit+0x4b5/0xa20

The client got NFS4ERR_IO, in six runs out of six. When small files were
written on the server after blockgc, with a sync first so that the freed
extents were no longer busy, they got those blocks, and the client's
write through the layout replaced 978944 bytes of their data before the
LAYOUTCOMMIT. A LAYOUTGET and LAYOUTCOMMIT 30 seconds apart, before
blockgc runs, leave the client's data in place.

Mark the inode also when a write mapping ends past EOF and nothing was
allocated, the same way as for an allocation, before the blocks are
handed out. With this, the same test keeps the blocks past blockgc, and
the LAYOUTCOMMIT after 360 seconds succeeds with the data in place.

To share the update with the allocation case, set a local update_inode
flag in both cases, call xfs_fs_map_update_inode() in one place below
them, and move the log force into xfs_fs_map_update_inode().

Changes in v2:
- Set a local update_inode flag in both cases and update the inode in
  one place, and move xfs_log_force_inode() into
  xfs_fs_map_update_inode(), as Christoph suggested:
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261012124118.GB32488@lst.de
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261012-xfs-pnfs-eof-prealloc-v1-1-e4864d917a00@samsung.com

Tested on nfsd-testing d918c664efd5 with the same change on top, all in
QEMU guests with KASAN and lockdep, XFS on an NVMe/TCP namespace shared
by the server and the client. In fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.c, XFS for-next
differs from that tree only by commit e3c682dd1130 ("xfs: map pNFS
layouts to the end of the extent again"), which does not change the
outcome of the new check.

- the reproducer above (local pynfs tests, not posted), with the layout
  held for 360 seconds, and with small files written on the server after
  blockgc, with and without a sync first: with the patch the inode is
  marked preallocated at LAYOUTGET, blockgc keeps the 960 KiB, and the
  LAYOUTCOMMIT succeeds with the client's data in place and the small
  files untouched. Without it, on the same base, both small-file
  variants had blockgc free the blocks and the LAYOUTCOMMIT shut XFS
  down;
- pynfs block, with BLOCK5 from patch 1/3 of the pynfs series at
  https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261014-pynfs-block-commit-v1-0-1723979f495f@samsung.com
  (its BLOCK6 to BLOCK10 need the LAYOUTCOMMIT series below) and four
  local layout extent tests, with and without XFS_DEBUG:
  13 pass, BLOCK3 fails with NFS4ERR_BADXDR for its empty layoutupdate,
  as without this patch;
- fstests generic/075, 091 and 263 with the Linux client over the block
  layout: only 075 fails, with an fsx size error, as without this patch,
  and xfs_fs_commit_blocks() returned 0 for all 10324 LAYOUTCOMMITs;
- W=1 builds of fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.o on XFS for-next 0be6da616ab5 and on
  nfsd-testing d918c664efd5: no warnings.

This patch and v2 of "xfs: refuse pNFS LAYOUTCOMMITs of ranges without
blocks" and of "xfs: make pNFS LAYOUTCOMMIT stable the way fdatasync
does", sent earlier today, all change fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.c. They apply to
XFS for-next in any order, with the same result:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261014-xfs-pnfs-commit-hole-v2-0-d3a02a79ab6c@samsung.com
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261014-xfs-pnfs-commit-datasync-v2-0-c11341a189b5@samsung.com

Dave's "XFS: Atomic multi-extent operations via rolling transactions"
V2 rewrites this code in 37/38: the inode update moves into the
allocation transaction, and the path that allocates nothing returns
early. A write mapping that ends past EOF without an allocation would
still need the flag set there:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260819001442.1451892-38-dgc@kernel.org

Chuck pointed this out in the review of the ->map_blocks series, whose
patch 7 will carry the same check for all mappings of a call:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/4de5356f-bc4d-4f1a-9c81-fce09b1b46fd@slotpi15m67
