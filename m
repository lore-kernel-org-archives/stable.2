net/smc: serialize link group free work scheduling

This patch takes the link group list lock in smc_lgr_schedule_free_work()
around the lgr->freeing check and the mod_delayed_work() call. The goal is
to stop a concurrent smc_lgr_free_work() from setting freeing and cancelling
the work between the check and the rearm, which would leave a timer pending
on a freed link group.

[Severity: Medium]
Is lgr_lock enough to protect lgr->freeing? freeing is a 1-bit bitfield,
and it shares a u8 with sync_err and terminating:

net/smc/smc_core.h:struct smc_link_group {
	...
	u8			sync_err : 1;	/* lgr no longer fits to peer */
	u8			terminating : 1;/* lgr is terminating */
	u8			freeing : 1;	/* lgr is being freed */
	...
}

Both neighbouring bits are written without lgr_lock. One example is
smc_clc_wait_msg():

	smc->conn.lgr->sync_err = 1;
	smc_lgr_terminate_sched(smc->conn.lgr);

Another is __smc_lgr_terminate():

	lgr->terminating = 1;

Each of these stores is a read-modify-write of the whole byte.
smc_smcd_terminate() and smc_lgr_free_work() set freeing = 1 under
lgr_lock. Can a concurrent sync_err or terminating store write back a stale
byte and lose that freeing = 1?

In the sync_err case, smc_lgr_terminate_sched() then returns early because
the lgr is already unlinked, so freeing is never set again.

Consider a later smc_conn_free() that passed its unlocked list_empty()
check before the unlink. Once __smc_lgr_terminate() has cancelled
free_work, that call could reach smc_lgr_schedule_free_work() with
conns_num == 0. It would read freeing == 0 under the new lock and rearm the
timer on an lgr that is about to be freed.

Would it work better to give freeing its own storage (for example a bool),
or to make every writer of that byte hold lgr_lock?

[Severity: High]
Does this fully close the rearm race? The commit message says a rearm
"either precedes the freeing transition and is caught by the subsequent
cancellation, or sees freeing set and is skipped". That only holds if every
teardown path sets lgr->freeing under lgr_lock before it cancels free_work.

smc_lgr_cleanup_early() unlinks the lgr under lgr_lock but never sets
freeing:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_lgr_cleanup_early() {
	...
	spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock);
	/* do not use this link group for new connections */
	if (!list_empty(&lgr->list))
		list_del_init(&lgr->list);
	spin_unlock_bh(lgr_lock);
	__smc_lgr_terminate(lgr, true);
}

__smc_lgr_terminate() then cancels only once, outside the lock. It sets
terminating, not freeing:

net/smc/smc_core.c:__smc_lgr_terminate() {
	if (lgr->terminating)
		return;	/* lgr already terminating */
	/* cancel free_work sync, will terminate when lgr->freeing is set */
	cancel_delayed_work(&lgr->free_work);
	lgr->terminating = 1;
	...
	smc_lgr_cleanup(lgr);
	smc_lgr_free(lgr);
}

On an SMC-D server, smc_listen_work() drops smc_server_lgr_pending after
it sends the ACCEPT. A second connection (conn2) from the same peer can
then join the first-contact lgr.

If the first connection then fails (no CONFIRM, or a DECLINE), teardown
goes through:

smc_listen_work()->smc_listen_decline()->smc_conn_abort()->
    smc_lgr_cleanup_early()->__smc_lgr_terminate()

Meanwhile conn2 can be freed on another CPU:

CPU0 (conn1 abort)                CPU1 (smc_conn_free(conn2))
                                  !list_empty(&lgr->list) is true
                                  smc_lgr_unregister_conn(conn2)
smc_lgr_cleanup_early()
  list_del_init(&lgr->list)
  __smc_lgr_terminate()
    cancel_delayed_work()
    lgr->terminating = 1
                                  lgr->conns_num == 0
                                  smc_lgr_schedule_free_work()
                                    spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock)
                                    lgr->freeing == 0
                                    mod_delayed_work()
    smc_lgr_free()
                                  smc_lgr_put() drops last reference

This would leave free_work's timer pending on a kfree'd lgr, which is the
same __run_timers use-after-free as in the KASAN report.

Should smc_lgr_cleanup_early() set lgr->freeing under lgr_lock? Or should
smc_lgr_schedule_free_work() also skip the rearm when the lgr is unlinked
or terminating?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. Can a
smc_lgr_free_work() callback that has already started running race with
lgr teardown?

smc_lgr_free_work() holds no reference on the lgr and dereferences it
straight away:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_lgr_free_work() {
	...
	smc_lgr_list_head(lgr, &lgr_lock);
	spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock);
	if (lgr->freeing) {
	...
}

Suppose the idle timer fires and the worker starts, but is delayed before
this point (by preemption, or on PREEMPT_RT). A teardown can then set
freeing and reach __smc_lgr_terminate(). Examples are smc_smcd_terminate()
from an ISM peer shutdown event in smcd_handle_sw_event(),
smc_lgr_terminate_sched(), and smc_smcd_terminate_all() or
smc_smcr_terminate_all(). The only cancellation there is:

	cancel_delayed_work(&lgr->free_work);

That call neither cancels nor waits for a callback that is already
running.

With no connections left, smc_lgr_free() destroys lgr->tx_wq. free_work is
on system_percpu_wq, so this does not drain it. smc_lgr_put() then calls
__smc_lgr_free(), which frees the lgr.

When the worker resumes, it takes spin_lock_bh() on a lock pointer loaded
from freed memory. If the stale freeing bit reads 0, it also calls
list_del_init() and smc_lgr_free() a second time.

Should teardown use cancel_delayed_work_sync() where the context allows,
or should the queued work hold its own lgr reference?
