As long as they use a filesystem that is proven to be safe for
untrusted user mounts, I have no problems with that model...

Right, kernel-implemented block device based filesystems ain't those
filesystem...

You mean like I've been doing for XFS journal structure verification
that I've already pointed to in this thread? i.e. this patchset:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20261013060204.3138690-1-dgc@kernel.org/

is almost entirely LLM generated code that I've directed and
reviewed. I'm just about ready to post the second version, of which
the only external reviews I've got are from an LLM (sashiko). 

So, yeah, I'm already capable of using LLMs to write complex XFS
code, and to write it -fast-. With this level of complexity, I'm
generally only seeing LLMs review the code (i.e. sashiko). None of
the work I've done like this has had a human actually provide review
comments.

If no humans have the time/bandwidth to review what are increasingly
necessary changes (e.g. to stem the flow of shitty LLM fuzzer
generated bug fixes), then we've got a major problem with our merge
processes....

Yeah, I think that for untrusted filesystem images, the only sane
solution is to get them out of the kernel altogether.
