[ Upstream commit 9c99db3a2080b8c2cbbb1100369586a9bea43321 ]

stmmac_mac_link_down() clears the MAC's transmit and receive enable bits.
stmmac_mac_link_up() is expected to set them again through
stmmac_mac_set(..., true), but it first switches on the negotiated speed
and returns early for a speed the switch does not list. The MAC is then
left gated off.

The speed selection is split into three switches, keyed on the interface.
The generic branch -- taken for everything that is neither USXGMII nor
XLGMII, so including PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_10GBASER -- lists only SPEED_2500,
SPEED_1000, SPEED_100 and SPEED_10.

MGBE on Tegra234 runs 10GBASE-R into an Aquantia AQR113C. That PHY does
rate matching, so phylink_link_up() replaces the media speed with the
MAC-side interface speed before calling into the MAC:

	case RATE_MATCH_PAUSE:
		speed = phylink_interface_max_speed(link_state.interface);
		duplex = DUPLEX_FULL;

The driver is therefore called as

	stmmac_mac_link_up(interface=10GBASER, speed=10000, duplex=1)

which falls through to "default: return;". The interface stops passing
traffic after the first link flap.

The failure is easy to misread. The link still comes up, because the PHY
is polled over MDIO and needs no MAC, so the interface reports carrier 1
at the media speed. The DMA is untouched, so its start bits stay set and
descriptors are still consumed. Only the MAC itself is gated off: the
receiver counts nothing (mmc_rx_framecount_gb stops advancing, RE is 0)
and nothing reaches the wire (TE is 0). The interface survives boot only
because stmmac_hw_setup(), called from ndo_open, enables the MAC
unconditionally -- so the problem appears only once the cable has been
unplugged and plugged back in, and "ip link set dev <ethX> down && ip
link set dev <ethX> up" appears to fix it.

The interface is not what the speed bits depend on: with the single
exception of 2.5G, which is selected through the XGMII block on USXGMII
and through the regular speed bits otherwise, each speed maps to one
field of struct mac_link. The per-interface switches are speed
validation, and phylink already validates the speed against
priv->hw->link.caps. So collapse the three switches into one keyed on the
speed alone, keeping the interface test only for the 2.5G case. This
covers 10G on 10GBASE-R, and equally 5G, and 1G/100/10 on USXGMII, all of
which hit "default: return;" today.

A core that does not support a speed leaves the corresponding mac_link
field at 0, and phylink will not offer it that speed in the first place.
For dwxgmac2 at 10G, link.xgmii.speed10000 is XGMAC_CONFIG_SS_10000,
which is 0 and is the correct speed selection for a 10GBASE-R MAC: ctrl
then equals old_ctrl, the register write is skipped, and execution
reaches stmmac_mac_set(..., true).

Log an error in the default case, since a speed with no entry here leaves
the MAC disabled and the symptom does not point at the cause.
