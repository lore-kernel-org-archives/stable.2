cgwb_kill() takes an offline memcg's wbs out of bdi->cgwb_tree, but
inodes that are still being dirtied stay attached to them. When a
replacement container keeps appending to those files, its foreign
flushes fail with -ENOENT in wb_get_lookup(), and it sleeps in
balance_dirty_pages() for seconds to minutes.

Fall back to searching bdi->wb_list, where killed wbs stay until they
are released. With commit 168a8c13159c ("writeback: size foreign
flushes by target wb dirty pages"), the flush is then sized from the
wb's own dirty pages and writes out what the replacement dirtied.

Test, on top of that commit: a cgroup appends to 1000 files at
250MiB/s and is removed, then a second cgroup keeps appending to the
same files under a 4G parent limit. Worst lag of the second writer
behind schedule over 120s, in three runs:

  without this patch   85.3s  46.9s  52.1s
  with this patch       1.0s   1.0s   1.1s

At Honeycomb, a container that reads from Kafka and writes columnar
files to a host volume stalls for 30-60s after each deploy replaces it
(v6.18). This is likely the cause: the stall looks the same as in the
reproducer (little CPU use, lag growing linearly and then recovering),
though we haven't traced it in production yet.

Based on vfs-7.4.misc, next to Xin Yin's 168a8c13159c, which fixes the
sizing but not the lookup of a removed cgroup's wb. Each helps without
the other; this one also applies cleanly to mainline. On mainline
(fd179f8a05be), without 168a8c13159c, the test from the changelog gave
52.8s, 73.3s and 5.2s worst lag before this patch and 1.0s, 1.0s and
1.0s after.

Trigger: a cgroup dirties files and is removed while they are still
dirty; a sibling keeps appending to the same files under a parent memory
limit. Symptom: cgroup_writeback_by_id() returns -ENOENT and the sibling
stalls in balance_dirty_pages(). Minimal recipe below; the harness that
produced the numbers (paced writer, lag per second, MODE=alive control)
is at https://gist.github.com/lizthegrey/2209d831930588f63076bdc0ac7b78e2.

On ext4, syncing before the removal doesn't reliably help: writeback can
leave inodes I_DIRTY_SYNC after syncfs, and cleanup_offline_cgwbs_workfn()
then skips the dying wb entirely (2 of 3 runs at 5000 files; a second
syncfs avoided it in 5 of 5). On XFS one syncfs left the wb clean in 5
of 5 runs.

Harness settings for all numbers: MEM_MAX=max POD_MAX=4G RATE_MBPS=250,
plus NFILES=5000 SYNC_OLD=1 (or 2) for the syncfs runs and
NFILES=500000 OLD_SECS=120 SYNC_OLD=1 POD_HOP=10 for the 500k-file runs.

Also reproduced unpatched on bare-metal arm64 with Ubuntu's 7.0 kernel
(ext4 on a loop device): 12.9s worst lag with the old cgroup removed,
2.5s with it kept.

Tested: arm64 KVM guests (virtme-ng), ext4 and XFS on virtio. No lockdep,
PROVE_RCU, DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP or DEBUG_PAGEALLOC reports. W=1, sparse
and checkpatch --strict clean.
No new warnings building arm64 defconfig with and without
CGROUP_WRITEBACK, allnoconfig, arm multi_v7_defconfig with
CGROUP_WRITEBACK, and the touched files (W=1) under arm64 allmodconfig
and x86_64 defconfig with CGROUP_WRITEBACK.

Not tested: x86, production, linux-next.

Workaround until this lands: lowering vm.dirty_expire_centisecs from
3000 to 500 cut the worst lag on unpatched mainline to 4.8s, 4.6s and
14.3s, but did not remove the stall.

Stable: please take 168a8c13159c too. Without it the flush is sized from
the dead memcg's own dirty pages, so this only helps while it has some.
f6988c90671e (already in mainline and tagged for stable) also matters:
on XFS with 500k synced inodes and the pod cgroup removed 10s later, the
handover was slow enough without it that the replacement fell 21-22s
behind (vfs-7.4.misc), against 1.0-1.2s with it (mainline).
Before 5.14 there is no offline_cgwbs cleanup, but the bdi->wb_list walk
should still apply.

Not covered: after a blkcg association change, wb_get_lookup() finds the
new clean wb, so the fallback doesn't run.

Developed with Claude Opus 5.5, which wrote the code, the reproducers
and first drafts of this text, and ran the builds and VM tests. I drove
the investigation from the production symptoms, designed the
experiments and controls (repeated runs, parent-commit baselines,
testing this patch on its own), and reviewed the analysis, code and
results.

Minimal recipe:
	#!/bin/bash
	# As root, cgroup v2, in a directory on ext4/xfs/btrfs ($DIR).
	cg=/sys/fs/cgroup/wbmini
	mkdir $cg && echo +memory > $cg/cgroup.subtree_control
	echo 4G > $cg/memory.max
	mkdir $cg/old $cg/new
	append() {  # append $1 blocks of $2 to each of 1000 files
		for i in $(seq 1000); do
			dd if=/dev/zero of=$DIR/f$i bs=$2 count=$1 \
			   oflag=append conv=notrunc status=none
		done
	}
	(echo $BASHPID > $cg/old/cgroup.procs
	 append 8 1M            # old owner writes the files...
	 append 1 64k)          # ...and exits with all of them dirty
	rmdir $cg/old           # its cgroup goes away while they are dirty
	bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:cgroup_writeback_by_id { @ret[(int32)retval] = count(); }' &
	sleep 3
	time (echo $BASHPID > $cg/new/cgroup.procs
	      append 4 1M)      # replacement keeps appending to the same files
	kill -INT $!; wait
	rmdir $cg/new $cg
	# Unpatched: many @ret[-2] (-ENOENT) and the append stalls.
	# Patched: @ret[0] only.
