7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@kernel.org>

commit f9ece060cc43eae8a1f148737d193ba0d07b8f88 upstream.

The futex state is used to prevent a waiter from attaching to the lock
owner while the owner runs the futex cleanup in exit() or exec().

Only the state transition from FUTEX_STATE_OK to FUTEX_STATE_EXITING must
be done with the task's pi_lock held, the transition away from
FUTEX_STATE_EXITING has no serialization requirements on the writer side,
but it's completely non obvious why. It's magically protected by
exit_pi_state(), which operates under tsk::pi_lock, as that's the state
which has to be correct when the waiter observes the new state.

OTOH, taking the pi_lock in futex_cleanup_end() is not a performance issue
because at that point the lock should be uncontended in the vast majority
of cases.

Aside of that the handling of FUTEX_STATE_EXITING in attach_to_pi_owner()
and handle_exit_race() is confusing at best.

Protect the store in futex_cleanup_end() with tsk::pi_lock, handle
FUTEX_STATE_EXITING in attach_to_pi_owner() explicitly and document how
this is supposed to work.

+ * Futex kernel state:
+ *
+ * The kernel tracks the task state in p::futex::state to protect against exit()

+ *
+ * - FUTEX_STATE_OK when the task is alive and waiters can be attached
+ *
+ * - FUTEX_STATE_EXITING when the task cleans up the robust list and pi
+ *   state. Concurrent waiters cannot attach anymore and have to wait until the
+ *   cleanup is finished to re-evaluate the potential changes of robust list and
+ *   pi state cleanups.
+ *
+ * - FUTEX_STATE_DEAD when the task has cleaned up the robust list and
+ *   is about to fully exit.
+ *
+ * exec() switches back to FUTEX_STATE_OK after the cleanup.
+ *
+ * The state has two related locks:
+ *
+ * 1) p::pi_lock
+ *
+ *    p::pi_lock has to be taken by the waiter when evaluating the state to
+ *    protect against a concurrent exit/exec cleanup by the owner. If the state
+ *    is OK then the waiter can be attached to the owner while still holding
+ *    pi_lock.
+ *
+ *    The cleanup code has to hold it for all state transitions to ensure that
+ *    the stores to the state cannot be reordered against previous stores on
+ *    which the waiter correctness depends on.
+ *
+ * 2) p::futex::exit_mutex
+ *
+ *    The mutex is acquired when the cleanup starts and released at the end. It
+ *    obviously is not serializing the owner's cleanup against itself. It is
+ *    used to avoid a live lock caused by a waiter preempting the owner's
+ *    cleanup. Such a waiter would busy loop forever waiting for the owner to
+ *    finish the cleanup.
+ *
+ *    To prevent this, waiters have to drop all locks when observing
+ *    FUTEX_STATE_EXITING and block on the mutex. When the owner releases the
+ *    mutex after finishing the cleanup the waiters make progress and
+ *    re-evaluate the situation.
