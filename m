Hi Dust,

Thanks for writing this up and for the pointer from my abort_work patch.

You describe three tiers, with lgr, link and device as the transport one.
I was not sure where the buffer descriptor fits. It does not seem to
follow the lgr: smc_buf_unuse() returns conn->rmb_desc to lgr->rmbs, and
smc_buf_get_slot() can then hand it to another connection while the lgr is
still alive.

Two places look like they can outlive it:

- a splice reader still holding pipe pages, since smc_buf_unuse() does not
   consult conn->splice_pending;

- smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() and smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival(), which
   read conn->rmb_desc after smc_cdc_rx_handler() has already left
   conns_lock. On the is_reg_err path smcr_buf_unuse() frees the
   descriptor rather than recycling it.

Have you already considered the descriptor in this model? Would it need
its own kref, or is it meant to sit inside the transport tier? I may be
missing something here.

One smaller question, on the boundary rule. The SMC-D side already looks
close to what you describe: smcd_handle_irq() holds smcd->lock across both
the lookup and the tasklet_schedule(), and smc_ism_unset_conn() clears the
slot under the same lock. The SMC-R receive path drops conns_lock between
the lookup and the action. Is that difference something the refactor
would make uniform, or is there a reason the receive path cannot hold the
lock that long?

If it would be useful, I can write up the lifetime assumptions I have run
into while working through the teardown paths. Please tell me if that
helps, or if it would only repeat what you already have.

Thanks,
Hidayath
