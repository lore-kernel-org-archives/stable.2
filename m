Hi Ted,

Thanks for pointing us to xfstests and gce-xfstests. We had not
included this regression coverage in our validation, and we appreciate
you explaining both the testing approach and the stable-rc review
process.

We are going to start including filesystem regression testing to our
backport checks, and started your recommended ext4/all, XFS/4k and
Btrfs/4k auto matrix locally under QEMU/KVM.

Our initial unpatched/patched runs showed some differences in both
directions. We cannot yet attribute those to the series, so we have
paused the patched comparison and are running three complete
iterations on the same unpatched baseline to assess repeatability.

We will follow up once we have firmer results.

Thanks,
Artem Dinaburg
