From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

[ Upstream commit e231d2e8f80d3649ecd3851b7f2abdfbe606c04b ]

A worker that is the last one to go to sleep while work is pending asks
for another worker. io_wq_dec_running() bumps ->nr_running on behalf of
the new worker and queues create_worker_cb() as task_work for the owner
of the io-wq. Until that has run, everybody else takes it that a worker
is running which is going to look after the work list: io_wq_enqueue()
doesn't create one, and other workers that go to sleep don't find
themselves to be the last.

If the worker that made the request exits, io_worker_exit() cancels the
task_work, and io_worker_cancel_cb() drops ->nr_running without a look at
the work list:

worker A                   worker B                 io_wq_enqueue()
blocks, work is pending
  nr_running++
  queues create_worker_cb()
wakes, handles the work
idle timeout, decides to exit
                           picks up work 1
                                                    queues work 2
                                                    B is on the free list
                                                    still: wakes B
                           work 1 blocks
                             nr_running 2 -> 1
io_worker_exit()
  io_worker_cancel_cb()
    nr_running 1 -> 0

Work 2 has to wait for work 1, although there is room for more workers.
It takes an owner that doesn't get around to run its task_work for the
time of the idle timeout, less if the worker exits because its affinity
was changed or the io-wq is marked exit-on-idle.

Let the worker stay around until its request has been dealt with. Only
the worker itself sets ->create_state, so it can't be set behind its
back once it has decided to leave.
