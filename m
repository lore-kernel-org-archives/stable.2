Seems there's no choice but to work around the process by sending out
clean cherry picks, so I've done so.

I guess I need to start using lei as well to get stable emails for
subsystems I'm interested in as well, to work around the apparent
deprecation of the subsystem mailing lists.

As for Greg/Sasha creating incorrect backports by using 'patch' instead
of 'git cherry-pick', I guess the workaround, at least for my own
commits that I might have time to check this for, is that I need to redo
every clean cherry-pick myself and verify that what was sent by
Greg/Sasha actually matches, as Greg/Sasha's process may instead patch a
different place in the file that has the same 1 line of context.

Just seems really time consuming for everyone involved to be working
around these unnecessary issues.
