It's the only one available, because xfs_setup_devices aliases
ddev_targp to rtdev_targp for internal rt volumes:

	if (mp->m_sb.sb_rtstart) {
		if (mp->m_rtdev_targp) {
			xfs_warn(mp,
		"can't use internal and external rtdev at the same time");
			return -EINVAL;
		}
		mp->m_rtdev_targp = mp->m_ddev_targp;
	}

So we're doing that anyway.  We could separate them by creating a second
buftarg with a duplicate struct file, but that would involve a bunch of
rototillingi because a fair amount of code changes behavior on
rtdev==ddev now.

The only field that the media verification code uses is bt_nr_sectors,
which it uses to trim verification requests to wherever the filesystem
thinks is the end of the device.  I could change that to call
bdev_nr_sectors() to fix the bug, but then we'd have to deal with media
failures for LBAs outside of the filesystem, which didn't seem ideal.

Also, if someone asynchronously reports a media error in the internal
rtdev to us through fs_holder_ops, the report will mention a range that
is beyond bt_nr_sectors but actually within the filesystem.
xfs_dax_notify_failure currently does the right thing because it doesn't
check bt_nr_sectors, but that also feels wrong. ;)

So I went with making bt_nr_sectors bigger because that felt the least
awkward.  IIRC it's supposed to represent the location of the end of the
filesystem on a particular blockdev, not the highest LBA that the fs
can xfs_buf_read(), right?

I found it accidentally while triaging another bug that LOLLM found.
I turned on the tracepoints (and btrace) for debugging and noticed that
it wasn't issuing reads for the internal rt device:

# mkfs.xfs /dev/sda -r zoned=1
# mount /dev/sda /mnt/scratch
# trace-cmd <big ugly command line> &
# xfs_io -x -c 'verifymedia -r' /mnt/scratch

--D
