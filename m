[ Upstream commit 77c57daf98a2ad95ec9ac1371caeff8939cc1f58 ]

In nvme_ns_head_ctrl_ioctl(), once we drop the SRCU read lock we should
not reference the NS to lookup the controller, so use the available
controller pointer directly.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

The local tree is **7.3.0-rc4** (`v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37`). The
candidate is a one-line use-after-unlock fix in the NVMe multipath ioctl
path; the rest of this write-up is the forensic check of whether that
fix belongs here as a stable backport.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE**
Record: `[nvme] [don't reference] Avoid using the namespace object after
dropping the SRCU lock in nvme_ns_head_ctrl_ioctl()`

**Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS**
Record:
- `Reviewed-by: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>` (NVMe co-maintainer)
- `Signed-off-by: John Garry <john.g.garry@oracle.com>` (author)
- `Signed-off-by: Keith Busch <kbusch@kernel.org>` (NVMe maintainer;
  applied the patch)
- No `Fixes:` tag (expected for this review pipeline)
- No `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org` (expected)
- No `Reported-by:`, `Tested-by:`, `Link:`, or syzbot tags

Later mailing-list review also produced `Reviewed-by: Hannes Reinecke
<hare@kernel.org>` (not copied into the committed message).

**Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT**
Record:
- **Bug:** After `srcu_read_unlock(&head->srcu)`, the code still did
  `nvme_ctrl_ioctl(ns->ctrl, ...)`.
- **Symptom/failure mode:** Use of `ns` after the SRCU critical section
  ends. `nvme_find_path()` does not take an `ns` kref; SRCU is what
  keeps `ns` alive. After unlock, `nvme_ns_remove()` can finish
  `synchronize_srcu(&ns->head->srcu)` and `nvme_put_ns()` → `kfree(ns)`.
  Loading `ns->ctrl` is then a use-after-free.
- **Version info:** None in the message. History shows the pattern dates
  to `48145b62563a9` (v5.13-rc1 era, 2021).
- **Root cause:** The function already saved `struct nvme_ctrl *ctrl =
  ns->ctrl` and used it for `nvme_put_ctrl(ctrl)`, but the ioctl call
  still went through `ns->ctrl` after unlock.

**Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES**
Record: Not hidden. The subject is explicit. This is a real lifetime/UAF
fix, not style cleanup. The local `ctrl` variable existed specifically
to survive the unlock; the ioctl call was the leftover unsafe use.

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES**
Record:
- File: `drivers/nvme/host/ioctl.c` — 1 insertion, 1 deletion
- Function: `nvme_ns_head_ctrl_ioctl()`
- Scope: single-file, one-line surgical fix under
  `CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH`

**Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE**
Record:
Before:
```
struct nvme_ctrl *ctrl = ns->ctrl;
nvme_get_ctrl(ns->ctrl);          /* still under SRCU — OK */
srcu_read_unlock(&head->srcu, srcu_idx);
ret = nvme_ctrl_ioctl(ns->ctrl, ...);  /* ns used after unlock — BUG */
nvme_put_ctrl(ctrl);
```
After:
```
ret = nvme_ctrl_ioctl(ctrl, ...);  /* uses the pointer saved under SRCU
*/
```
The `nvme_get_ctrl()` before unlock keeps the controller object alive;
only the namespace object was left unprotected.

**Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM**
Record:
- **Category:** use-after-free / lifetime (memory safety), SRCU
  protection dropped too early relative to `ns` use
- **Mechanism:** Path lookup is SRCU-only. Callers drop SRCU *on
  purpose* before controller ioctls so a Delete Namespace passthrough
  cannot deadlock on `synchronize_srcu` (comment at the
  `nvme_ns_head_ioctl` call site). Concurrent `nvme_ns_remove()` can
  then free `ns` while the old code still loaded `ns->ctrl`.

**Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY**
Record:
- Obviously correct: use the already-captured, refcounted `ctrl`.
- Minimal: one identifier change; no API, locking, or control-flow
  change.
- Regression risk: very low. `ctrl` is assigned under SRCU and pinned
  with `nvme_get_ctrl()` before unlock.

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES**
Record:
- Buggy `nvme_ctrl_ioctl(ns->ctrl, ...)` after unlock introduced in
  `48145b62563a9` (`nvme: fix controller ioctl through ns_head`, Minwoo
  Im, 2021-04-22).
- First appeared around **v5.13** (`tags/v5.13-rc1~19^2~1^2~6`).
- `struct nvme_ctrl *ctrl = ns->ctrl` was added in that same commit —
  they saved `ctrl` for `nvme_put_ctrl()` but still passed `ns->ctrl`
  into the ioctl.
- The SRCU unlock in this function has been there since `3e7d1a55165bd`
  / the 2021 rewrite. This is long-lived buggy code, not a recent
  regression.

**Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG**
Record: No `Fixes:` tag. The introducing commit is `48145b62563a9`, and
`git merge-base --is-ancestor 48145b62563a9 HEAD` succeeded, so the
buggy code is in this lineage.

**Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES**
Record:
- Nearby John Garry commits (`627e8bb91a8fd` requeue/SRCU order,
  `a11e0a4cb4189` / `9952f3882ecba` cdev lifetime) are **separate**
  bugs. This diff does not depend on them.
- Not labeled `patch X/Y`. Standalone one-liner.
- Later `86f9536c2d8f4` only changes the sparse annotation `__releases`
  → `__releases_shared`; not a prerequisite.

**Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS**
Record: John Garry is a regular NVMe contributor (Oracle). Around this
date he also fixed related lifetime issues, but this patch is
independent. Maintainers Christoph Hellwig, Keith Busch, and Hannes
Reinecke all reviewed/acked it.

**Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS**
Record: None. The preimage already has `ctrl`, `nvme_get_ctrl`, and
`srcu_read_unlock`. The patch applies standalone.

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION**
Record:
- `b4 dig -c 77c57daf98a2ad`: https://patch.msgid.link/20260706125402.61
  5277-1-john.g.garry@oracle.com
- `b4 dig -a`: **v1 only**; committed version is that v1.
- Thread (saved via `b4 dig -m`):
  - Christoph Hellwig: “Looks good:” + `Reviewed-by`
  - Keith Busch: “Thanks, applied to nvme-7.3.”
  - Hannes Reinecke: `Reviewed-by: Hannes Reinecke <hare@kernel.org>`
- No NAKs, no requests for a v2, no reviewer concern about the approach.
- No explicit `Cc: stable` in the thread (not a negative; this pipeline
  expects that).

**Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH**
Record (`b4 dig -w`): To/Cc were `hch@lst.de`, `kbusch@kernel.org`,
`sagi@grimberg.me`, `axboe@fb.com`, `linux-nvme@lists.infradead.org`.
Subsystem maintainers were on the original mail and reviewed it.

**Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT**
Record: No `Reported-by` / syzbot / bugzilla. Found by code inspection
(same author was auditing NVMe lifetime vs SRCU around the same time).
The race is still concrete: ioctl + path removal.

**Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES**
Record: Standalone `[PATCH]`, not a numbered series. Sibling lifetime
patches are independent.

**Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY**
Record: lore.kernel.org `/stable/` returned HTTP 403 from this
environment. **UNVERIFIED:** no confirmed stable@ discussion. That is
expected for a candidate that has not been auto-selected.

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

semcode MCP tools are not available; callers/callees were traced with
grep and file reads.

**Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS**
Record: `nvme_ns_head_ctrl_ioctl()` only.

**Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS**
Record:
- `nvme_ns_head_ioctl()` — `block_device_operations.ioctl` for the
  multipath ns-head disk (`/dev/nvmeXnY`)
- `nvme_ns_head_chr_ioctl()` — `file_operations.unlocked_ioctl` for the
  generic ns-head char device (`/dev/ngXnY`)
Both call it when `is_ctrl_ioctl(cmd)` is true: `NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD`,
`NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN64_CMD`, or SED/opal ioctls.

**Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES**
Record: `nvme_get_ctrl` / `nvme_put_ctrl` (`get_device`/`put_device` on
`ctrl->device`), `srcu_read_unlock`, `nvme_ctrl_ioctl` (admin
passthrough / SED).

**Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN**
Record: Userspace ioctl on a multipath NVMe ns-head device. Reachable
from userspace. Admin commands typically need privileges, but that does
not make a kernel UAF acceptable; privileged management tools and path
teardown are exactly the production workload.

**Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS**
Record: Non-multipath `nvme_ioctl()` / `nvme_ns_chr_ioctl()` use
`ns->ctrl` without this SRCU drop; those `ns` objects are tied to the
open disk/cdev, so they are a different lifetime model. No second copy
of this exact post-unlock `ns->ctrl` load in `nvme_ns_head_ctrl_ioctl`.

---

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE

**Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?**
Record:
- Tree: **7.3.0-rc4** (`git describe HEAD` =
  `v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37`)
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 77c57daf98a2ad HEAD` → yes (the fix is
  already on this mainline snapshot)
- Preimage (`77c57daf98a2ad^`) still has `nvme_ctrl_ioctl(ns->ctrl,
  ...)` after unlock
- Introducing commit `48145b62563a9` is an ancestor; the bug has been in
  this lineage since ~v5.13
- Current `ioctl.c` already uses `nvme_ctrl_ioctl(ctrl, ...)`

This is a mainline 7.3-rc checkout, not a 6.x.y stable branch. The
question is still whether the *fix* is stable-worthy for this codebase.
The touched function, the `ctrl` local, and the SRCU unlock are all
present. The bug was not introduced after this tree branched.

**Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS**
Record: Clean apply on this code. The hunk is one argument change. Would
also apply cleanly to any tree that still has the 2021
`nvme_ns_head_ctrl_ioctl` shape (the `ctrl` local + post-unlock ioctl).

**Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE**
Record: This is the fix. No alternate older fix of the same `ns->ctrl`
load. Related commits fix different lifetime bugs.

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY**
Record: `drivers/nvme/host` — NVMe host ioctl/multipath. **IMPORTANT**
(common storage stack; not core mm/vfs, but widely deployed). Gated on
`CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH` (Kconfig: “If unsure, say Y.”).

**Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY**
Record: Active (io_uring passthrough, multipath, ioctl hardening). This
particular function body has been stable in shape since 2021.

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED**
Record: NVMe **multipath** users who issue controller ioctls on the ns-
head block or char device (`NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD` / `ADMIN64` / SED).
Datacenter NVMe-oF / dual-ported SSD setups.

**Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS**
Record:
- `srcu_read_lock` → `nvme_find_path` → controller ioctl →
  **intentional** `srcu_read_unlock` (to avoid deadlock with namespace
  delete) → old code loads `ns->ctrl`
- Concurrent `nvme_ns_remove()` (path loss, controller delete, admin
  Delete NS)
- Timing-dependent. Not every ioctl hits it; when it hits, it is a real
  UAF.
- Triggerable from userspace ioctl; typically privileged admin ioctls.

**Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY**
Record: Use-after-free of `struct nvme_ns` → KASAN report / oops /
potential memory corruption. **Severity: HIGH** (UAF in a production
ioctl path).

**Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO**
Record:
- **Benefit:** High — closes a UAF that has existed since v5.13 in a
  standard multipath ioctl path.
- **Risk:** Very low — one-line substitution of an already-saved,
  refcounted pointer.
- **Ratio:** Strongly favors backporting.

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE**

FOR:
- Real UAF: `ns` is SRCU-protected only; used after `srcu_read_unlock`
- `nvme_find_path()` does not take an `ns` kref (verified)
- `nvme_ns_remove()` does `synchronize_srcu(&ns->head->srcu)` then
  `nvme_put_ns()` → `kfree(ns)` (verified)
- Callers drop SRCU early on purpose so namespace delete can proceed —
  the window is intentional
- One-line, obviously correct, uses the pointer the original 2021 code
  already saved
- Reviewed by Hellwig, Busch, Reinecke; applied to nvme-7.3
- Bug present since ~v5.13; no extra prerequisites
- Userspace-reachable ioctl on common NVMe multipath hardware

AGAINST:
- No crash log / syzbot in the commit message (inspection-found)
- No `Fixes:`/`Cc: stable` (expected here; not a reason to reject)
- Gated on `CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH`
- This 7.3-rc4 snapshot already contains the commit (it landed for 7.3);
  that does **not** reduce technical merit for selecting it as a stable
  candidate

UNRESOLVED:
- Could not fetch lore.kernel.org in the browser (403); thread was
  recovered via `b4 dig -m`
- Could not search lore `/stable/` (403)

**Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — one identifier; reviewed by
   three NVMe maintainers
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — UAF on ns-head
   controller ioctl vs path removal
3. Important issue (crash/security/corruption/deadlock)? **PASS** — UAF
   → oops/corruption; HIGH
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — 1 line, one function
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — function and `ctrl` local
   exist; hunk is the existing post-fix form

**Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES**
Record: Not a device-ID/quirk/DT/build/docs exception. It is a normal
memory-safety bugfix.

**Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION**
This is a textbook stable candidate: a long-standing, small, obviously
correct UAF fix in NVMe multipath ioctl handling, with maintainer review
and no dependencies.

---

### What the commit solves (for stable users)
On `CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH`, controller ioctls on the namespace-head
device drop `head->srcu` before running the ioctl so a Delete Namespace
passthrough cannot deadlock. The namespace pointer is not refcounted
across that unlock. Passing `ns->ctrl` into `nvme_ctrl_ioctl()` after
unlock can dereference a freed `nvme_ns` if a path is removed
concurrently. Using the `ctrl` pointer saved under SRCU (already pinned
with `nvme_get_ctrl()`) closes that hole.

### Risk vs benefit
Benefit is a UAF/crash fix on a real ioctl path used with NVMe
multipath. Risk is essentially nil.

### Concerns
None for applicability on this tree’s NVMe ioctl code. Nearby Garry
lifetime patches are not required.
