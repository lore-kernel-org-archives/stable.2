Subject: ocfs2: find the xattr entry again after converting a block to a bucket
Date: Sat, 24 Oct 2026 23:10:09 +0800

ocfs2_xattr_create_index_block() turns a non-indexed xattr block into a
tree by copying it into a bucket, and the copy sorts the entries: a
block holds them in insertion order, a bucket by name hash.
ocfs2_xattr_update_xattr_search() nevertheless relocates the caller's
search by the index the entry had in the block, so unless the two orders
agreed it points at an unrelated entry, and nothing between there and
the write compares that entry's name with the one being set.

Setting an xattr whose new value no longer fits the block arrives here
with xs->not_found clear.  The block gave up because
ocfs2_xa_block_can_reuse() wants an exact namevalue size match, while
ocfs2_xa_bucket_can_reuse() only wants an entry at least as large as the
new one, so the bucket accepts a pair the block rejected and the update
lands on whichever entry the sort left at that index.  Equal padded name
lengths get that other attribute's value replaced in place and its name
left alone, so setxattr returns success while the attribute asked for
keeps its old value.  A longer one trips ocfs2_xa_reuse_entry()'s
BUG_ON, and a shorter one is refused by the bucket as well, so
ocfs2_xa_prepare_entry() wipes the entry and writes the new name over
it, leaving xe_name_hash describing a name that is no longer there.

Find the entry again by the name being set, matching the type as well.
The copy carries every entry and every name over unchanged, and (type,
name) pairs are unique within a block, so the match is exact.  The type
matters because the handlers strip their prefix before calling
ocfs2_xattr_set(), so user.foo and trusted.foo share a stored name, a
stored length and a hash, and both can sit in the same block.

The name has to come from xi rather than from xs->here: a failed set can
remove the entry xs->here names, and only the "growing" caller sets
ctxt->set_abort, which is what stops the conversion.  Scan every entry
rather than narrowing on the hash the way ocfs2_find_xe_in_bucket()
does, since an existing entry keeps the hash it was stored under, which
a kernel that sign-extended the name bytes made different from the one
computed now.  An empty result means the entry did not survive the
failed set and this has become an insert; leaving xs->here alone would
keep it pointing into the block, which is rewritten as a tree root
before the caller reads it again.
