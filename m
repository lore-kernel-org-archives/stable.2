6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Borislav Petkov (AMD) <bp@alien8.de>

[ Upstream commit f690e07859e67505e7106ef5b4fae5e8b71b2109 ]

Move the kernel build options abbreviations to the .txt file so that
they are together instead of one having to go hunt them in the .rst
file.

Tweak the formatting so that the inclusion of kernel-parameters.txt
still keeps the whole thing somewhat presentable in the html output too.
