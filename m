FYI, I took some time to take a closer look at this driver, and I found
a bunch more bugs:

- https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260723183438.GB93534@quark/
- https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260723192514.GA110634@quark/
- https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260723202704.GB110634@quark/
- https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260723205342.GC110634@quark/

Overall, I think this demotion is extraordinarily well justified.

The pending fixes for some bugs don't change the big picture.  In fact,
the introduction of BAM locking seems likely to exacerbate the
performance issues.

It would not be responsible to defer to the hardware vendor here.  The
community has a responsibility to uphold high technical standards,
especially for cryptography.
