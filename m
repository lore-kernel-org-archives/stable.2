Well we don't normally have drivers that are marked as BROKEN just
laying around in the tree these days, especially given that a LLM is
bound to do a drive-by and find lots of issues that people will not
realize doesn't matter given that the code is never actually built.

But hey, it's not my subsystem, if you want to keep it here, fine with
me, just asking :)
