A console port is not shut down when its last user closes it:
tty_port_shutdown() returns early when tty_port::console is set, so the
port stays initialized.  For an 8250 port this leaves its interrupt
requested or, for a port without an interrupt, its poll timer armed.

serial_core_remove_one_port() relies on tty_port_tty_vhangup() to shut
the port down before releasing its resources, but the hangup reaches
uart_hangup() -> uart_shutdown() only when a tty is attached.  For a
console that was opened and closed, for example a serial console whose
getty has been stopped, nothing shuts the port down.  The console is
unregistered, ->release_port() releases the registers and the core frees
uport->name while the port is still running.  On tty-next with 8250
ports:

 - A card bound to 8250_pci with an INTx interrupt and unbound through
   sysfs keeps its interrupt requested after the driver is gone.  The
   irqaction name points to the freed uport->name, so reading
   /proc/interrupts is a slab-use-after-free in irq_seq_show().

 - A polled (irq = 0) MMIO port with UPF_IOREMAP keeps running
   serial8250_timeout() after serial8250_release_port() has cleared
   membase, which dereferences NULL in timer softirq context about
   10 ms after "console [ttyS5] disabled".

After unregistering the console and before releasing the resources, call
uart_shutdown().  It runs with port->mutex held, as for its other
callers, and with no tty, so it also drops DTR and RTS.  For a port that
is not initialized, because the hangup already shut it down or because it
is suspended, uart_shutdown() leaves the hardware alone and only releases
what the core still holds, such as the transmit buffer of a suspended
port.

The bug goes back to v4.9 (761ed4a94582), but scoped_guard() for
mutexes was only added in v6.5, so this version doesn't build on the
6.1, 5.15 and 5.10 stable trees.  For those I'll send a backport that
uses mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() instead and is otherwise the same.

I hit the bug on real hardware.  My serial console is a polled ASPEED
BMC VUART, then driven by an out-of-tree module.  After I stopped its
getty, unloading the driver oopsed in mem32_serial_in() from
serial8250_timeout().

History: before 761ed4a94582, uart_close() called uart_shutdown() for
every port, consoles included.  761ed4a94582 made console ports skip the
shutdown on close.  be2c92b8f164 reverted that part and 4dda864d7307
reinstated it, all within v4.9.  Keeping a console running after close is
intended, but the removal path was never updated for it.

Tested in a QEMU guest on tty-next 36844ea19656 with KASAN, using in-tree
8250_pci and a "serial8250" platform port.  Reproducers are available on
request.  Without this patch:

  8250_pci with INTx, reading /proc/interrupts after unbind:
    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in string+0x3b6/0x4c0
     irq_seq_show+0x34d/0x810

     serial8250_unregister_port+0x10d/0x6c0
     pciserial_detach_ports+0x92/0x160

  Polled MMIO port (irq 0, UPF_IOREMAP) after removal:
    printk: console [ttyS5] disabled
    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
    RIP: 0010:mem32_serial_in+0x74/0xa0
     serial8250_timeout+0x44/0x140
     call_timer_fn+0x32/0x260

With this patch both cases are clean: the IRQ is freed on unbind,
rebinding restores the console, and the polled port is shut down on
removal.  A port held open across removal and a console that was never
opened did not fail before and still work.  v2 was retested the same
way.  W=1, sparse and checkpatch --strict are clean.

Also tested on real hardware: the ASPEED BMC VUART that hit the bug
(polled MMIO, irq 0) as the console, now bound to 8250_pci with my
pending ASPEED support patch [1], on a 7.0.14 distribution kernel with
both patches.  After stopping the getty, opening and closing the port,
and unbinding the PCI device, there is no oops.  Rebinding restores the
console, the getty and in-band IPMI.  That run used v1; v2 behaves the
same on that path.

Not tested: serial drivers other than 8250, and removing a port while it
is suspended (the case v2 adds).

AI assistance: an LLM coding assistant (Claude, model claude-opus-5-5, in
Claude Code) analysed the crash, wrote the reproducers and the patch, and
built and ran the test kernels.  Two other LLMs reviewed the result
(GPT-5.6 Sol via Codex, and Claude Fable 5.1 via Claude Code).  I reviewed
it as well.

Changes in v2:
- Call uart_shutdown() without checking tty_port_initialized() first,
  so that a console port removed while suspended also gets its transmit
  buffer freed and its suspended flag cleared (found by Sashiko's
  review of v1).  uart_shutdown() already skips the hardware shutdown
  for a port that is not initialized.  Comment and changelog updated.
- Use scoped_guard() for port->mutex, as elsewhere in the function, and
  drop the comment (Greg).
