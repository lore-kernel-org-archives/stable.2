If a few days of testing in mm-new is successful, the patch will me moved
into mm.git's mm-unstable branch, which is included in linux-next

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/process/submit-checklist.rst when testing your code ***

Subject: mm/rmap: duplicate a PMD mapping as one in folio_dup_file_rmap_pmd()
Date: Wed, 04 Nov 2026 21:40:55 +0100

Patch series "mm/huge_memory: copy PMDs at fork like the PTE path does",
v5.

copy_huge_pmd() decides what to copy at fork by its own rules, apart
from copy_present_ptes(): a lockless check for special PMDs, and a skip
of every file THP. Following David's review of v3, this series makes it
decide the way the PTE path does, under the page table lock, with
vm_normal_page_pmd(). That fixes the two bugs v1-v3 were about. The
patches:

1. folio_dup_file_rmap_pmd() duplicated a PMD mapping as HPAGE_PMD_NR
   PTE mappings. It had no caller until patch 2.
2. File THPs are copied at fork instead of being refaulted by the
   child, as their PTEs would be.
3. The special-PMD read moves under the lock. That closes the race with
   a driver zap (vfio-pci, panthor) and the missing page table deposit
   on ppc64 hash that Sashiko found in v1.
4. A selftest for 1 and 2.

Stable
======

The race (since v6.12) and the ppc64 hash NULL deref (since v7.1) are
fixed in patch 3, which only works on top of the copy rework in patch
2, and patch 2 is the first caller of the helper patch 1 fixes. So
patches 1-3 carry Cc: stable, as David suggested on v4. They will not
apply to 6.12 as they are, I will do the backports.

A related refcount bug in copy_huge_pud() for device DAX is fixed in
a separate series, as it does not depend on this one:
https://patch.msgid.link/20261021-vstor-150143-copy_huge_pud-folio-refcount-v1-0-8bd88551f9be@virtuozzo.com

Testing
=======

v5 on v7.4-rc1, x86_64 with 4 NUMA nodes, the series with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM, KASAN and lockdep:

- fork_file_thp (patch 4) skips on v7.4-rc1, where fork leaves file
  THPs to a refault, and fails in both cases without patch 1, where
  ShmemPmdMapped drops when the child exits and the kernel reports
  "Bad page cache";
- with the series it passes, also under migrate_pages() of the parent
  and under reclaim in a small memcg, where some runs skip; with other
  processes churning PMD-mapped shmem it passes or skips, never fails;
- cow, guard-regions, uffd-unit-tests, uffd-wp-mremap,
  split_huge_page_test, mremap_test, soft-dirty, pagemap_ioctl,
  migration, madv_populate, transhuge-stress and khugepaged pass as on
  v7.4-rc1.

The runs below are from v4, on v7.3-rc7 in a KVM guest with 4 vCPUs,
x86_64. Patches 1-3 changed since only by the device private CoW check.

Race with a driver zap. The guest's QXL device is bound to vfio-pci in
no-IOMMU mode, BAR0 of 64 MB mapped with PMDs. The reproducer below
forks while a second thread clears PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY through the vfio
config region after a random delay of up to 1 ms; the child waits for
the write to finish and reads one byte of each 2 MB of the BAR. A child
that reads anything without SIGBUS kept a stale mapping. I have not hit
it without help, so a test-only debugfs knob adds an mdelay(2) between
copy_pmd_range()'s lockless pmd_is_huge() and the PMD locks:

  +-----------------------+-------+-------+----------------+
  | kernel                | delay | forks | stale children |
  +-----------------------+-------+-------+----------------+
  | 7.3-rc7               | none  | 20900 | 0              |
  | 7.3-rc7               | 2 ms  | 150   | 128            |
  | 7.3-rc7 + this series | none  | 3000  | 0              |
  | 7.3-rc7 + this series | 2 ms  | 400   | 0              |
  +-----------------------+-------+-------+----------------+

ppc64 hash is not tested on hardware. On x86 a test-only hack makes
arch_needs_pgtable_deposit() true and mremap move the table, as on
ppc64 hash. Without the series the first child of the reproducer oopses
at exit in pgtable_trans_huge_withdraw(); with it the reproducer and
the mm selftests pass.

Cost
====

fork() now copies file THPs instead of leaving them to a refault, which
costs fork() a reference, an rmap update and a counter per huge PMD and
saves the child a fault per huge PMD it touches. fork() of a process
with 4 GB of shmem THPs mapped MAP_PRIVATE and an anon_vma on the VMA,
medians of 2000 forks:

  +-----------------------+------------+-------------------------+
  | kernel                | fork()     | fork(), child reads all |
  +-----------------------+------------+-------------------------+
  | 7.3-rc7               | 86-129 us  | 2380-2620 us            |
  | 7.3-rc7 + this series | 230-355 us | 820-930 us              |
  +-----------------------+------------+-------------------------+

Notes
=====

- drm_gem_shmem and mshv_vtl map special PMDs with
  vmf_insert_pfn_pmd() as well.
- copy_huge_pud() still differs from the PMD tail in that it does not
  mark a shared PUD clean in the child or handle uffd bits.
- A reproducer is at the Link:


This patch (of 4):

folio_dup_file_rmap_pmd() passes PGTABLE_LEVEL_PTE to
__folio_dup_file_rmap() for HPAGE_PMD_NR pages, so it adds HPAGE_PMD_NR
PTE mappings to the folio instead of one PMD mapping.

The helper has no caller yet, the next patch adds the first one. Pass
PGTABLE_LEVEL_PMD, as folio_try_dup_anon_rmap_pmd() does.
