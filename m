net/smc: serialize early link group cleanup with termination

This patch makes smc_lgr_cleanup_early() check lgr->freeing under the link
group list lock, so it does not tear down a group that another path
already owns. It also takes a temporary lgr reference in smc_conn_abort().
For newly created groups, it takes another temporary reference from
publication in smc_lgr_create() until registration in smc_conn_create()
finishes.

[Severity: Low]

This early return only gives exclusive teardown ownership in combination
with two other pieces: the lgr->freeing = 1 write later in
smc_lgr_cleanup_early(), and freeing being a standalone bool instead of a
bitfield that shares storage with sync_err and terminating.

Both of those come from the earlier series patch "net/smc: serialize link
group free work scheduling". The baseline smc_lgr_cleanup_early() never
sets freeing.

The commit body only says:

    The existing locked freeing transition then claims exclusive teardown
    ownership

The explicit dependency is stated only in the v2 changelog below the ---
line, and git am drops that part.

The context lines of this hunk don't include the lgr->freeing = 1 line,
so the hunk applies cleanly to a tree without the prerequisite. The two
patches also carry different Fixes: tags (8e316b9e7260 and f9aab6f2ce57).

Suppose a stable tree takes only this patch. smc_lgr_cleanup_early()
would then check freeing but never claim it. Couldn't
smc_lgr_terminate_sched(), smc_smcd_terminate() or
smc_smcr_terminate_all() still claim the group after the check, so that
both paths enter __smc_lgr_terminate()?

Could the body mention the dependency? Another option is a "# needs ..."
annotation on the Cc: stable line.

[Severity: High]

This is a pre-existing issue and wasn't introduced by this patch. Still,
the exclusive teardown protocol that this check builds on doesn't seem
safe against a free_work instance that is already running.

smc_lgr_free_work() holds no lgr reference. It dereferences the group
before it can see that freeing was claimed:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_lgr_free_work() {
    ...
	smc_lgr_list_head(lgr, &lgr_lock);
	spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock);
	if (lgr->freeing) {
    ...
}

__smc_lgr_terminate() only uses the non-synchronous cancel:

	/* cancel pending free_work; a running instance rechecks freeing */
	cancel_delayed_work(&lgr->free_work);

Neither smc_lgr_free() nor __smc_lgr_free() waits for free_work before
kfree(lgr).

Can this sequence happen on an idle group (conns_num == 0)?

CPU1 (free_work timer expired)
smc_lgr_free_work()
  <preempted before spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock)>

CPU2 (peer DELETE_LINK with SMC_LLC_FLAG_DEL_LINK_ALL)
smc_llc_process_cli_delete_link()
  smc_lgr_terminate_sched()
    lgr->freeing = 1;
    schedule_work(&lgr->terminate_work);
smc_lgr_terminate_work()
  __smc_lgr_terminate()
    cancel_delayed_work(&lgr->free_work);   <- does not wait
    smc_lgr_free()
      smc_lgr_put()
        __smc_lgr_free()
          kfree(lgr);

CPU1 resumes
  smc_lgr_list_head(lgr, &lgr_lock);   <- reads freed lgr
  spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock);

The resumed worker would take a spinlock through a pointer loaded from
freed memory. If the slab has been reused and reads freeing == 0 with an
empty tree, the worker could also run list_del_init() and smc_lgr_free()
on foreign memory.

Other terminators would reach the same window, for example an LLC protocol
violation, or smc_smcd_terminate() from an ISM event.

The smc_conn_abort()->smc_lgr_cleanup_early() path doesn't look like a
realistic trigger here. smc_lgr_schedule_free_work() is only called once
conns_num reaches zero, and the creating connection stays registered
until its own abort.

Could free_work hold its own lgr reference, taken when it is armed and
dropped when the work exits or is cancelled successfully? Alternatively,
the final put could use cancel_delayed_work_sync() when it is not running
from free_work itself.

[Severity: High]

The temporary hold taken in smc_lgr_create() keeps the lgr allocation
alive between list_add_tail() and smc_lgr_register_conn(). Does it also
stop a terminator from tearing the group down in that window?

smc_conn_create() only takes lgr->conns_lock around
smc_lgr_register_conn(conn, true). Nothing rechecks lgr->freeing under
lgr_lock. For SMC-D, this sequence seems possible:

CPU1 (first-contact connect or listen)
smc_conn_create()
  smc_lgr_create()
    smc_lgr_hold(lgr);
    list_add_tail(&lgr->list, lgr_list);

CPU2 (peer ISM GID or shutdown event)
smc_smcd_terminate()
  lgr->peer_shutdown = 1;
  list_move(&lgr->list, &lgr_free_list);
  lgr->freeing = 1;
  schedule_work(&lgr->terminate_work);
smc_lgr_terminate_work()
  __smc_lgr_terminate()
    rb_first(&lgr->conns_all) is NULL, kill loop skipped
    smc_lgr_free()
      destroy_workqueue(lgr->tx_wq);
      smc_ism_put_vlan(); put_device();
      smc_lgr_put(lgr);   <- only the temporary hold remains

CPU1
  write_lock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock);
  smc_lgr_register_conn(conn, true);  <- cannot fail for SMC-D,
                                         sock_hold(), conns_num++
  smc_lgr_hold(conn->lgr);
  smc_lgr_put(conn->lgr);             <- temporary hold dropped
  return 0;

The kill loop never visited this connection, so conn->killed stays clear.
Two problems seem to follow.

First, smc_tx_consumer_update() can get -EPIPE from
smc_cdc_get_slot_and_msg_send() because peer_shutdown is set. It would
then queue work on the destroyed workqueue:

		if ((smc_cdc_get_slot_and_msg_send(conn) < 0) &&
		    !conn->killed) {
			queue_delayed_work(conn->lgr->tx_wq, &conn->tx_work,
					   SMC_TX_WORK_DELAY);

Second, smc_conn_free() sees list_empty(&lgr->list) and skips
smc_lgr_unregister_conn(). That leaks the sock_hold() taken at
registration. The final smc_lgr_put() would then free the lgr while
smc_conn_lgr_valid() still returns true for the connection.

The publication-to-registration window itself predates this patch. Before
it, the later write_lock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock) was a direct
use-after-free.

The commit message says "On success, acquire the ordinary connection
reference before releasing the temporary hold". This handoff doesn't seem
to serialize registration with the freeing claim.

Could first-contact registration take lgr_lock, fail if lgr->freeing is
set, and then take conns_lock and register? That would match the lock
order of the reuse path. Alternatively, could the group be published only
after its first connection is registered?

The SMC-R variant looks mostly blocked. smc_lgr_free() clears the links,
so registration then fails with SMC_CLC_DECL_NOACTLINK and takes the
fixed failure path. It is unclear whether a concurrent smcr_link_clear()
could still hand out a link while it is clearing.
