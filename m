[ Upstream commit 7185b6d33b170cae54fb562ead44452810b6c231 ]

Some Realtek USB SD readers with a tray keep raw SD_CD asserted
when an empty tray is inserted. The MMC core then repeatedly tries to
initialize non-existent media, sees command timeouts, calls ->get_cd()
again, and starts the same detect cycle over.

Do not qualify media by open-coding MMC commands in ->get_cd().
Instead, let the normal MMC rescan path probe the card. If an
initialization command times out before a card has been attached,
suppress the raw SD_CD signal so the host can settle and the USB
parent can autosuspend.

Clear the suppression only when raw SD_CD drops. On the affected tray
reader, changing media requires removing and reinserting the tray, so
a low CD transition is the signal that a new insertion attempt can be
trusted again.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Local tree is **7.3.0-rc4** (`v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37`). The change
is a hardware quirk in `drivers/mmc/host/rtsx_usb_sdmmc.c`: tray-style
Realtek USB readers can keep `SD_CD` asserted with no media, so MMC init
times out, `->get_cd()` still says present, and the detect cycle never
stops.

===============================================================
PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS
===============================================================

Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE
Record: **[mmc/rtsx_usb_sdmmc] [suppress] [stop false card-detect after
init timeout]**
- Subsystem: `mmc: rtsx_usb_sdmmc`
- Verb: “suppress” (workaround / prevent a false-positive CD loop)
- Intent: do not keep reporting media present after an init timeout

Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS
Record:
- **Fixes:** none (expected for this review)
- **Reported-by / Tested-by / Reviewed-by / Cc: stable:** none in the
  commit
- **Acked-by:** Greg Kroah-Hartman `<gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>`
- **Signed-off-by:** Sean Rhodes `<sean@starlabs.systems>` (author); Ulf
  Hansson `<ulfh@kernel.org>` (MMC maintainer)
- **Link:** none on the commit; mailing-list thread recovered via `b4
  dig` (Phase 4)
- Notable: Greg’s Ack is on the series, not a `Cc: stable` tag. Absence
  of `Fixes:` / `Cc: stable` is not treated as a negative.

Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT
Record:
- **Bug:** Some Realtek USB SD readers with a tray leave raw `SD_CD`
  asserted when the tray is empty.
- **Symptom:** MMC core keeps initializing non-existent media, hits
  command timeouts, calls `->get_cd()` again, and repeats. Cover letter
  (Phase 4) also reports USB reset churn and the USB parent never
  autosuspending.
- **Root cause:** `->get_cd()` trusts raw `SD_CD` and does not
  distinguish “tray in, no card” from real media.
- **Fix approach:** Do not probe from `->get_cd()`. After an init
  timeout with no attached `mmc->card`, suppress raw `SD_CD` until it
  actually drops (tray remove/reinsert).
- **Version info in the message:** none. Cover letter tested on Linux
  7.0.0-27-generic, RTS5129 `0bda:0129`, StarLite Mk V.

Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES
Record: **Not hidden.** It is an explicit hardware-quirk / detect-loop
fix. “Do not qualify media by open-coding MMC commands in `->get_cd()`”
refers to dropping an RFC approach, not cleanup-for-its-own-sake.

===============================================================
PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS - LINE BY LINE
===============================================================

Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES
Record:
- **File:** `drivers/mmc/host/rtsx_usb_sdmmc.c` only
- **Scope:** +12 / −1, single-file surgical change
- **Functions / sites:**
  - `struct rtsx_usb_sdmmc`: add `bool suppress_cd`
  - `sdmmc_get_cd()`: honor/clear suppression
  - `sdmmc_request()`: set suppression on pre-attach `-ETIMEDOUT`
  - `rtsx_usb_init_host()`: initialize the flag

Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE
Record:
1. **`sdmmc_get_cd()`:** Before: `val & SD_CD` → `card_exist = true`,
   return 1. After: if CD is low, clear `suppress_cd` and report no
   card; if CD is high but `suppress_cd` is set, fall through to
   `no_card` (return 0).
2. **`sdmmc_request()` error path:** Before: any `cmd->error` re-ran
   `sdmmc_get_cd()`. After: if `!mmc->card && cmd->error == -ETIMEDOUT`,
   set `suppress_cd` first, then re-run `get_cd()` so the next detect
   sees no media.
3. **Init:** `suppress_cd = false` in `rtsx_usb_init_host()`.

Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM
Record: **[Hardware workaround + logic/correctness]**
- Broken: raw `SD_CD` is a false present signal on empty-tray
  RTS5129-class readers.
- MMC core (`mmc_rescan`) treats `get_cd()==1` as “probe now”; init
  times out; `sdmmc_request` calls `get_cd()` again; still 1; with
  `MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL` set from `runtime_resume`, detect is rescheduled
  every `HZ` (`drivers/mmc/core/core.c` `out:` path).
- Fix: after a timeout before `mmc->card` exists, lie about CD until the
  line drops, so rescan takes the `get_cd()==0` power-off path instead
  of retrying init.

Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY
Record:
- **Quality:** Minimal and readable. `WRITE_ONCE`/`READ_ONCE` are
  justified: `sdmmc_get_cd()` is also called from `mmc_rescan` and
  `rtsx_usb_sdmmc_runtime_resume`, not only from `sdmmc_request`.
- **Regression risk (low–medium, contained):** a real card that times
  out on first init with `SD_CD` still high is hidden until CD drops.
  That matches tray hardware (remove/reinsert tray). For slot readers,
  CD normally drops on removal, so a retry is still “pull and reinsert.”
- **Not** a new API, not a new driver, no userspace ABI.

===============================================================
PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION
===============================================================

Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES
Record:
- Buggy `if (val & SD_CD)` / `sdmmc_request` timeout→`sdmmc_get_cd()`
  path: **c7f6558d84afe** (“mmc: Add realtek USB sdmmc host driver”,
  2014), first in **v3.16-rc1**.
- Nearby OCP updates (`d2e6fb2c31a07`, `6fb942b85a1ab`, 2025) are
  unrelated to CD polarity; this tree has them.

Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG
Record: **No `Fixes:` tag on this commit.** Companion series patch 1/2
(`483c948324a38`) has `Fixes: bb400d2120bd` (“mfd: rtsx_usb: Defer
autosuspend while card exists”); `bb400d2120bd` **is** an ancestor of
this tree. This commit does not depend on that `Fixes:` target in its
own diff.

Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES
Record:
- **4dad599b8b5d1** — drop always-on poll; set `MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL` only
  while runtime-resumed. That is why a stuck-high CD becomes a permanent
  rescan loop.
- **235b630eda072** — same author, earlier `rtsx_usb` interrupt-detect
  restore, **`Cc: stable`**, S3 delay from `mmc_rescan`. Same hardware
  family.
- **No follow-ups** on `rtsx_usb_sdmmc.c` / `rtsx_usb.c` after
  `7185b6d33b170` in this tree.
- This is **patch 2/2** of “rtsx_usb: fix tray-reader false card detect
  and autosuspend”. Companion **1/2** is `483c948324a38` and is already
  in this tree.

Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS
Record: Sean Rhodes (Star Labs) is a regular contributor for this laptop
hardware, not the MMC maintainer. Related work: `483c948324a38` (series
1/2), `235b630eda072` (stable-bound detect/PM). Maintainer weight is
Ulf’s application + Greg’s Ack.

Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS
Record:
- Diff is self-contained in `rtsx_usb_sdmmc.c` (`suppress_cd` only).
- Full “USB parent autosuspends with empty tray” behavior is the
  **matched pair** with 1/2; this commit alone still stops the init-
  timeout storm.
- In **this** checkout both patches are present. No missing helper/API.

===============================================================
PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH
===============================================================

Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION
Record:
- `b4 dig -c 7185b6d33b170`: **[PATCH v2 2/2]**
  https://patch.msgid.link/1d6f22a3777e78d6232cbe7dc3aa17ded8fc32e2.1783
  352430.git.sean@starlabs.systems
- `b4 dig -a`: v2 series “rtsx_usb: fix tray-reader false card detect
  and autosuspend” (2026-07-06). RFC (not in this mbox) open-coded MMC
  commands from `->get_cd()`; v2 dropped that.
- Thread saved to mbox (5 messages). lore.kernel.org WebFetch returned
  **403**; discussion taken from `b4 dig -m`.
- **Ulf Hansson (2026-07-10):** queued for -next for more testing;
  *“Potentially we should also tag these for stable kernels, but let's
  get it tested a bit more in next first.”* No NAK.
- **Greg KH:** “No objection from me” + Acked-by. No stable NAK.
- Applied version is v2 (latest matching patch-id). No later unapplied
  revision found.

Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH
Record (`b4 dig -w`): To Ulf Hansson; Cc Greg KH, Arnd, Ricky Wu
(Realtek), Lee Jones, Roger Tseng, Dan Carpenter, Jisheng Zhang, linux-
mmc, linux-kernel. MMC maintainer picked it; Greg acked the series.

Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT
Record: No syzbot/bugzilla. Author is a hardware vendor. Cover letter
gives a concrete repro (empty tray vs card vs S3) and three minutes of
empty-tray soak with no timeout/reset churn. Severity from reporter:
detect livelock, USB reset churn, autosuspend never happens.

Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES
Record: Standalone as a CD-suppression fix; series 1/2 is the parent
autosuspend/cache change. This tree has both. No later fixup series
found.

Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY
Record: `lore.kernel.org/stable/` fetch **403 (UNVERIFIED via lore)**.
In-tree/mbox: Ulf deferred `Cc: stable` until -next soak. Commit landed
in **mmc-v7.3** (pulled to Linus for 7.3). From July -next through
**7.3-rc4** (this HEAD) there are **no follow-up fixes**. That is the
soak Ulf asked for.

===============================================================
PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
===============================================================

Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS IN THE DIFF
Record: `sdmmc_get_cd()`, `sdmmc_request()`, `rtsx_usb_init_host()`;
field `suppress_cd`.

Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS
Record:
- `sdmmc_get_cd` ← `rtsx_usb_sdmmc_ops.get_cd` ← `mmc_rescan()` /
  `_mmc_detect_card_removed()`; also `sdmmc_request()` on command error;
  also `rtsx_usb_sdmmc_runtime_resume()`.
- `sdmmc_request` ← `mmc_host_ops.request` (MMC I/O / init commands).
- Reachable from USB card-reader use (plug, tray insert, rescan work),
  not a dead path.

Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES
Record: `rtsx_usb_get_card_status()`, `rtsx_usb_write_register()` on OCP
clear, `mmc_request_done()`. No new allocations or locks.

Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN
Record: USB parent resumes child on apparent insert → `runtime_resume`
sets `MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL` and may `mmc_detect_change` → `mmc_rescan` →
`get_cd()==1` → init cmds → `sdmmc_request` timeout → without this patch
`get_cd` still 1 → rescan forever. Userspace does not need a syscall;
inserting an empty tray is enough.

Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS
Record: No other `suppress_cd` in-tree. PCI Realtek host
(`rtsx_pci_sdmmc.c`) has its own `sdmmc_get_cd`; this quirk is USB-tray-
specific. Same author’s prior `rtsx_usb` interrupt-detect restore is the
closest sibling.

===============================================================
PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE
===============================================================

Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?
Record: **Yes.** File and functions exist. Pre-fix logic (trust raw
`SD_CD`) has been in the driver since v3.16. This checkout is
**7.3.0-rc4**; commit `7185b6d33b170` is already an ancestor of HEAD
(merged via `mmc-v7.3`). The bug class is old; the fix is present here.
That does **not** substitute for a technical-merit decision.

Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS
Record: **Clean apply on this tree.** Hunks match current `sdmmc_get_cd`
/ `sdmmc_request` / `rtsx_usb_init_host`. OCP fields already exist.
`WRITE_ONCE`/`READ_ONCE` available. Companion 1/2 already here.

Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE
Record: No alternate fix for empty-tray false CD. `4dad599b8b5d1` made
poll runtime-gated (necessary context, not a substitute). No later
revert.

===============================================================
PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT
===============================================================

Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY
Record: **MMC host driver** (`CONFIG_MMC_REALTEK_USB`, RTS5129/39 USB
readers) on top of `MISC_RTSX_USB`. **IMPORTANT** for affected laptops
(very common Realtek USB readers), not core mm/VFS. Peripheral relative
to the whole kernel, but not staging.

Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY
Record: Mature driver (2014) with occasional PM/detect/OCP work. Not a
newly added subsystem.

===============================================================
PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================

Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED
Record: **Driver-specific / config-specific**
(`CONFIG_MMC_REALTEK_USB`). Strongest hit: tray-style RTS5129
(`0bda:0129`) as on Star Labs StarLite Mk V; other rtsx USB readers
share `get_cd`. Slot-only devices keep working as long as CD drops on
removal.

Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS
Record: Insert empty tray (or leave tray in with no card) so `SD_CD`
stays high. Common on that hardware. Not a userspace exploit path.
Timing is deterministic, not a thin race.

Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY
Record:
- Repeated MMC init + command timeouts
- `MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL` rescan every second
- USB reset churn (author, cover letter)
- USB parent stuck out of autosuspend (power)
- Related earlier bug: long S3 entry while `mmc_rescan` is frozen
- **Severity: HIGH** for affected machines (livelock of detect + USB
  churn + PM), not a panic/UAF. Not LOW: the host never settles.

Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO
Record:
- **Benefit:** High for tray-reader laptops; stops detect storm and
  enables autosuspend (with 1/2, already here).
- **Risk:** Low. +12/−1, local flag, no locking change beyond
  `WRITE_ONCE`. Residual risk is “timeout on first init hides a present
  card until CD drops,” which is the intended tray semantics.
- **Ratio:** Benefit > risk.

===============================================================
PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS
===============================================================

Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE

**FOR backporting to this tree:**
- Real hardware bug on shipping RTS5129 tray readers; vendor-tested
  (insert, empty tray soak, S3).
- Failure is a detect livelock plus USB reset churn / failed autosuspend
  — user-visible stability and power, not cosmetics.
- Hardware-quirk class (false CD), which stable explicitly takes.
- Tiny, obviously structured, no new API.
- Driver and buggy `get_cd` path have existed since v3.16; this tree has
  that code.
- Greg Ack; MMC maintainer applied; Ulf only delayed stable tagging for
  -next soak — now past -next and through 7.3-rc4 with **zero** follow-
  up fixes.
- Same author already got a related rtsx_usb detect/PM fix into stable
  (`235b630eda072`).

**AGAINST:**
- Not a KASAN/crash/CVE.
- Ulf did not `Cc: stable` at merge (wanted -next first).
- Series 2/2: full autosuspend story wants 1/2 (already in this tree).
- Possible hide-until-reinsert if a real card times out during first
  init.

**UNRESOLVED:**
- Could not query lore.kernel.org/stable (HTTP 403). Relied on `b4` mbox
  + git history instead.

Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — v2 after RFC, runtime log on
   StarLite Mk V, Acked by Greg, merged by Ulf, no regressing follow-ups
   through 7.3-rc4.
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — empty-tray false CD,
   observed detect loop and USB churn.
3. Important issue? **PASS** — detect livelock / USB reset churn / PM
   stuck (HIGH), hardware quirk.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — one file, +12/−1.
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS** — internal flag only.
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — file/functions present;
   companion 1/2 present; applies cleanly.

Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES
Record: **Hardware quirk / workaround** for broken CD on tray readers
(same bucket as USB/PCI quirks).

Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION
This tree is 7.3.0-rc4. The driver and false-CD loop exist here; the
patch is small, tested, and a real hardware workaround. Ulf’s “test in
-next first” condition has been met (no revert, no fixup). It belongs in
this tree on technical merit.

**What it solves for users of this tree:** empty-tray Realtek USB SD
readers no longer hammer MMC init and USB, so the host can settle and
autosuspend.

**Risk vs benefit:** low code risk vs high impact on that hardware.

**Concerns:** none that block this tree; 1/2 is already here; no missing
prerequisites.
