Subject: [PATCH] mm/rmap: fix missing barrier between anon_vma init and
 vma->anon_vma publish

On arm64 server, we find that a task trying to grab the anon_vma lock
triggers hungtask.

INFO: task main:2354726 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

After analyzing the vmcore, we found the anon_vma->root->rwsem.count is
-1.  There is another anon_vma whose anon_vma->root->rwsem.count is 1, the
anon_vma->root->rwsem.owner shows the lock is held, but the stack of the
task shows the task doesn't hold the anon_vma lock.

After adding more debugging info, we found __anon_vma_prepare() reuses
anon_vma and triggers the UAF of anon_vma->root due to missing memory
barrier, leading to locking and unlocking two different anon_vma->root,
thus leading to an anon_vma will never be unlocked, and another anon_vma
couldn't be locked anymore.

This race requires two adjacent VMAs that are not merged but are
anon_vma-compatible (e.g., they differ in VMA_ACCESS_FLAGS that can be
changed by mprotect()).  Two threads fault on each VMA concurrently, both
calling __anon_vma_prepare() with only mmap_lock held for reading.

    THREAD A                             THREAD B
__anon_vma_prepare                __anon_vma_prepare
 find_mergeable_anon_vma() -> NULL
 anon_vma = anon_vma_alloc();
   anon_vma->root = anon_vma;
 // the two stores may be reordered
 vma->anon_vma = anon_vma;
                                   // finds A's anon_vma
                                   anon_vma = find_mergeable_anon_vma(vma);
                                   anon_vma_lock_write(anon_vma);
                                     // may still see the old root
                                     down_write(&anon_vma->root->rwsem);
                                   anon_vma_unlock_write(anon_vma);
                                     // see the new root, never unlock old
                                     up_write(&anon_vma->root->rwsem);

thread A triggers page fault and calls __anon_vma_prepare() to prepare
anon_vma for the faulting vma.  __anon_vma_prepare() allocates and
initializes a new anon_vma, and then publishes it to the vma with a plain
store.  anon_vma_prepare() only requires the mmap_lock to be held for
reading, so two threads can fault on adjacent VMAs at the same time.
While thread A publishes a new anon_vma, thread B could find the anon_vma
via find_mergeable_anon_vma() and then locks anon_vma->root->rwsem.

The store to anon_vma->root in anon_vma_alloc() and the store to
vma->anon_vma can be reordered.  The anon_vma_lock_write() and spin_lock()
only provide acquire semantics, which do not prevent prior stores from
being reordered after them.  The release semantics of the corresponding
spin_unlock() and anon_vma_unlock_write() come too late, the store to
vma->anon_vma is already published before they take effect.  As a result,
thread B can observe the following order:

    vma->anon_vma = anon_vma;
    anon_vma->root = anon_vma;

The anon_vma slab is SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, so a newly allocated anon_vma
may reuse memory from a previously freed one.  The constructor
(anon_vma_ctor) does not reset anon_vma->root, and __put_anon_vma()
doesn't clear it either, so the old root value persists until
anon_vma_alloc() overwrites it.  If that store isn't visible, thread B
reads a root that points to the old anon_vma and locks it.

As a result, thread B can call anon_vma_lock_write() with the old root,
and call anon_vma_unlock_write() with the new root, leading to an anon_vma
will never be unlocked, and another anon_vma couldn't be locked anymore
(its count is dropped from 0 to -1 due to wrong unlock).

To fix it, change the plain store `vma->anon_vma = anon_vma` to store
release, so that the fields of anon_vma are visible before anon_vma is
published to vma->anon_vma.

At read side, the load of anon_vma and anon_vma->root have address
dependency.  According to Documentation/memory-barriers.txt and some
investigations, only Alpha needs address-dependency barriers and it has
been handled by READ_ONCE() in reusable_anon_vma().

We reproduced this issue in v5.10 with KSM enabled.  The kernel doesn't
merge commit cf7e7a3503df ("mm: prevent KSM from breaking VMA merging for
new VMAs"), so there are many adjacent VMAs that aren't merged but are
compatible for anon_vma.

Without this fix, our production environment could reproduce this issue
about 2-5 times each month.  After adding a smp_mb() before
anon_vma_lock_write(anon_vma) in __anon_vma_prepare(), which is different
to this patch, this issue hasn't been reproduced for one month.
