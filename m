Thanks for catching this!

The backlog handling still looks a bit wrong though.  When you detach
a backlogged request after processing a normal request, there is
a gap before the backlogged request is added to the normal queue.

In that gap new requests could have come in and taken up the space
meant for the backlogged request.

I think this should be done atomically so that there is no gap
between the two operations, to ensure that the space is actually
reserved for the backlogged entry.

Once this is done, there should be no need to have a per-backlog
work struct, which means that you don't need to add a separate
work queue.  In fact, there may not be a need for a work struct
at all since this is all running out of process context anyway.

On a higher level, this driver should probably switch over to
using crypto_engine rather than doing backlog handling manually.

Cheers,
