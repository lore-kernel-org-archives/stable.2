7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Sergey Zagursky <gvozdoder@gmail.com>

commit 856c562c94964a74f63c6d5f38a1509a59a2357d upstream.

Since commit c6b1b34b5090 ("media: pci: intel: Add CVS support for IPU
bridge driver") the internal camera no longer works on laptops where the
sensor sits behind an IVSC, for example a Dell XPS 16 9640 (IPU6,
INTC10CF, ov02c10):

  intel-ipu6 0000:00:05.0: Found supported sensor OVTI02C1:00
  intel-ipu6 0000:00:05.0: Connected 1 cameras
  ivsc_csi intel_vsc-92335fcf-3203-4472-af93-7b4453ac29da: mei-csi probed
      without device fwnode!

No sensor subdevice is registered, the media graph has no sensor entity
and userspace finds no camera at all.

ipu_bridge_get_ivsc_csi_dev() first looks for the platform device named
"intel_vsc" and returns its mei-csi child. That device is created by
mei_vsc, which on this machine only appears once the LJCA USB bridge and
its SPI controller have probed, about a second after the IPU6 probe that
runs the bridge:

  07:59:29.297  platform INTC10CF:00 created (ACPI scan)
  07:59:41      intel-ipu6 probe -> ipu_bridge_init()
  07:59:42.391  platform intel_vsc created (mei_vsc)

The commit above added two fallbacks for CVS which match on the ACPI
companion alone. They are reached for every entry of ivsc_acpi_ids[],
IVSC IDs included. The IVSC ACPI device has two physical nodes:

  INTC10CF:00/physical_node  -> platform/INTC10CF:00  (no driver bound)
  INTC10CF:00/physical_node1 -> platform/intel_vsc    (mei_vsc)

so bus_find_device_by_acpi_dev(&platform_bus_type, adev) returns the bare
platform device. ipu_bridge_instantiate_ivsc() then attaches the IVSC
software node to that device instead of to the mei-csi client, the bridge
reports success, and the probe is never retried. mei_csi later probes
without a fwnode, the CSI-2 link is never described, and the sensor ACPI
device, which has an honoured _DEP on the IVSC device, is never
enumerated.

Before those fallbacks existed the lookup returned NULL here, the bridge
failed with -ENODEV and the probe was retried once the IVSC device had
shown up.

Skip those fallbacks for IVSC devices, keying on the IVSC IDs rather than
the CVS ones: new CVS IDs keep being added, whereas the IVSC list is
complete. CVS binds a driver to the ACPI device itself, so matching on the
companion stays unambiguous there.
