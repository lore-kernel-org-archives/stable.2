Yep -- to be clear, I didn't mean to change the IDR3_RIL naming, which
matches the architectural naming of the SMMU_IDR3.RIL field.

My concern was that 'RIL' was being used to refer to a range invalidate
operation (e.g. "a RIL"), which doesn't match any existing terminology,
and is opaque to the reader.

Using RANGE_INV / range_inv, along with "a range op" or similar in prose
sounds good to me.

Mark.
