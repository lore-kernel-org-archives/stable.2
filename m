The diag dump walks the socket hash table under a read_lock and
dereferences conn->lgr and conn->lnk. Several paths expose a window
where a hashed socket has freed or partially freed conn/lgr/lnk state.

First, smc_conn_abort() calls smc_conn_free() during early handshake
aborts while the socket is still hashed in SMC_INIT, synchronously
freeing the lgr on the smc_lgr_cleanup_early() path without holding the
hash write_lock. A concurrent diag reader can load a non-NULL conn->lgr
and dereference it after the kfree. Skip the connection, link group and
DMB attributes in __smc_diag_dump() for sockets in SMC_INIT or
SMC_CLOSED or fallen back to TCP, and take diag_mode from an is_smcd
flag cached at connection creation.

The state filter alone does not close the race. A connection aborted by
a failed handshake can keep its alert token, because smc_conn_free()
skips the unregister when smc_lgr_terminate_sched() has emptied
lgr->list; close_work may also have been queued before the abort, as the
CDC receive path is not excluded by the handshake's socket lock.
smc_close_passive_work() would then move the hashed socket from SMC_INIT
to SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1 or SMC_PROCESSABORT, states the filter does not
cover, and later run a passive-closing sock_put() that
smc_connect_decline_fallback() dropped already. Return early from
smc_close_passive_work() when the connection was freed; the check holds
the socket lock that every smc_conn_free() caller holds as well, so a
hashed socket with a freed connection stays in SMC_INIT or SMC_CLOSED
until release.

This changes the sock_diag output for such sockets: the connection, link
group and DMB attributes are omitted, which smcss does not read for
sockets in these states, while SMC_DIAG_FALLBACK is still reported and
an SMC-D socket in SMC_INIT or SMC_CLOSED still reports
SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCD from the cached flag. A fallback socket is a plain
TCP socket with no SMC connection state to report; the stale conn fields
left behind by smc_conn_abort() must not be read.

Second, in smc_conn_kill() on SMC-D with dmb_nocopy, smcd_buf_detach()
NULLs and frees conn->sndbuf_desc while the socket is still hashed. A
concurrent diag reader entering the CONNINFO block can dereference the
freed descriptor. Unhash the socket right before smcd_buf_detach(). As a
result, killed ACTIVE and APPCLOSEWAIT sockets that are still open are
no longer visible to smcss on loopback-ism devices.

Third, in the terminal teardown branches of smc_close_active_abort()
(PEERCLOSEWAIT and PROCESSABORT groups) and in smc_close_passive_work(),
smc_conn_free() drops lgr and lnk references while the socket is still
hashed. Unhash immediately before each smc_conn_free() call at those
sites. Sockets killed in those close states are therefore unhashed, and
their inuse accounting dropped, before close(), even if the fd is still
open.

Fourth, use smp_load_acquire() / smp_store_release() on sk_state to
order these checks on weakly ordered CPUs. A reader that observes
SMC_ACTIVE is guaranteed to see the connection setup that preceded the
store; a reader that observes SMC_CLOSED from smc_listen_out_err() skips
the connection fields in any case, so that particular store is hardening
kept for uniformity, not a required ordering.

Additionally, in __smc_diag_dump(), use the cached link->ibname instead
of link->smcibdev->ibdev->name, avoiding a NULL pointer dereference or
use-after-free of the IB device when __smcr_link_clear() zeroes the link
during concurrent SMC-R link failover. The link data is still read
without conns_lock or send_lock, so a dump racing a failover may
transiently report zeroed or mixed link fields; this does not affect
memory safety and the next dump reports the new link. Like the SMC
netlink link dump and the tracepoints, the name is the one cached at
link creation time.

Changes in v15:
- smc_close.c: return early from smc_close_passive_work() when
  conn->freed is set; the check runs under lock_sock and every
  smc_conn_free() caller holds the socket lock, so it cannot race with
  the free. A connection whose unregister was skipped because
  smc_lgr_terminate_sched() had emptied lgr->list keeps its alert token
  after a failed handshake, and a late peer CDC close or abort
  (smc_cdc_rx_handler() does not check conn->freed) queues close_work,
  which runs once the handshake thread has dropped the socket lock; it
  could move the hashed socket from SMC_INIT to SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1 or
  SMC_PROCESSABORT, states the SMC_INIT/SMC_CLOSED filter in
  __smc_diag_dump() does not cover, with conn->lgr pointing at a link
  group whose last reference smc_conn_free() already dropped, and later
  run a passive-closing sock_put() although
  smc_connect_decline_fallback() already dropped that reference on the
  failed handshake; add the Fixes tag for 2a0674fffb6b, which
  introduced the unregister skip in smc_conn_free(); close_work is also
  reachable without a stale token, because the CDC receive path queues
  it under bh_lock_sock(), which does not exclude the handshake
  thread's lock_sock(), so a close_work queued before the abort runs on
  the freed connection as well; that variant exists since close_work
  was introduced, hence the additional Fixes tag for 46c28dbd4c23
- smc.h, smc_core.c, smc_diag.c: cache the connection type in
  conn->is_smcd at smc_conn_create() and take diag_mode from it instead
  of dereferencing conn->lgr->is_smcd; v14 reported every non-fallback
  socket in SMC_INIT or SMC_CLOSED as SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCR, including
  SMC-D connections, which puts them in the wrong smcss -D / -R group;
  SMC-D sockets in SMC_INIT after smc_conn_create() and SMC-D sockets
  moved to SMC_CLOSED by smc_close_passive_work() or
  smc_close_passive_abort_received() while the fd is still open are
  affected; the v14 condition on diag_state in the diag_mode test is
  dropped together with the lgr deref
- commit message: reword the fourth item; with the SMC_CLOSED check in
  __smc_diag_dump() a reader that observes SMC_CLOSED never reads
  alert_token_local or conn->lgr, whatever the state was before
  smc_listen_out_err() stored it, so the smp_store_release() there is
  hardening, not a required ordering, and stable backporters should not
  treat it as a standalone fix

Changes in v14:
- smc_diag.c: also exclude SMC_CLOSED before dereferencing conn->lgr to
  determine diag_mode; a server socket that fails in
  smc_listen_decline() with rc < 0 reaches SMC_CLOSED hashed, with a
  stale alert_token_local left by smc_conn_free() when
  smc_lgr_terminate_sched() had already emptied lgr->list, and the lgr
  can be freed by terminate_work while a diag reader still holds the
  hash read_lock
- commit message: document the diag_mode change for SMC_CLOSED and the
  limits of the smp_store_release() in smc_listen_out_err()

Changes in v13:
- smc_diag.c: also skip the CONNINFO/LGRINFO/DMBINFO blocks for sockets
  with use_fallback set; the SMC_DIAG_FALLBACK attribute is still
  reported. After smc_lgr_terminate_sched() emptied lgr->list,
  smc_conn_free() skips smc_lgr_unregister_conn(), so a socket that then
  falls back and reaches SMC_ACTIVE can keep a stale alert_token_local
  and a diag reader could dereference the freed sndbuf/rmb/lgr; a
  fallback socket is a plain TCP socket with no SMC connection state to
  report
- smc_core.c: drop the v11 and v12 changes (unconditional
  smc_lgr_unregister_conn() in smc_conn_free() and the
  !lgr->terminating check in smc_lgr_schedule_free_work()); the v12
  check was racy against __smc_lgr_terminate() and the changes moved the
  patch away from the diag reader race, so smc_core.c is back to the v10
  change only; the Fixes tag for 2a0674fffb6b added in v11 is dropped
  with them
- commit message: state that using the cached link->ibname avoids the
  NULL pointer dereference and the IB device use-after-free, and that
  link fields may be transiently zeroed or mixed in a dump racing with a
  link failover, without affecting memory safety
- commit message: drop the claim that other kill paths leave the socket
  hashed; every smc_conn_kill() ends in smc_close_active_abort(), so
  sockets killed in the PEERCLOSEWAIT1/2, PEERFINCLOSEWAIT, PROCESSABORT
  and APPFINCLOSEWAIT states are unhashed before close() even if the fd
  is still open, and the dmb_nocopy unhash hides ACTIVE/APPCLOSEWAIT
  sockets on loopback-ism; smcss visibility thus depends on close state
  and device type; this supersedes the v10 entry below

Changes in v12:
- smc_core.c: guard smc_lgr_schedule_free_work() with !lgr->terminating
  in addition to !lgr->freeing, preventing free_work from being re-armed
  on a terminating LGR after smc_lgr_cleanup_early() has called
  __smc_lgr_terminate() (which sets terminating=3D1 and cancels free_work
  without setting freeing=3D1); without this a concurrent smc_conn_free()
  decrementing conns_num to 0 would re-arm free_work, and the subsequent
  kfree(lgr) in smc_lgr_free() would leave the armed work pointing at
  freed memory

Changes in v11:
- smc_core.c: unregister connection unconditionally in smc_conn_free()
  rather than gating it on !list_empty(&lgr->list), ensuring
  alert_token_local is always reset to 0
- commit message: add Fixes tag for 2a0674fffb6b and clarify that
  copying cached link->ibname eliminates the NULL dereference / UAF
  during concurrent link clearing

Changes in v10:
- smc_core.c: move the unhash out of the top of smc_conn_kill() into the
  smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy() branch, right before smcd_buf_detach(); th=
e
  other kill paths leave ACTIVE/APPCLOSEWAIT sockets open, so they must
  stay visible to smcss and keep their inuse accounting
- commit message: document the sock_diag output changes for sockets in
  SMC_INIT and SMC_CLOSED (extension attributes omitted, diag_mode of
  SMC-D in SMC_INIT) and that ibname is the name cached at link creation

Changes in v9:
- af_smc.c: change plain store in smc_listen_out_err() to
  smp_store_release(&newsmcsk->sk_state, SMC_CLOSED) to order the
  preceding alert_token_local clear (done under write_lock_bh() inside
  smc_conn_free()) before the sk_state write; pairs with the
  smp_load_acquire() in __smc_diag_dump() to close a use-after-free on
  weakly ordered CPUs where a diag reader could observe SMC_CLOSED while
  conn->lgr still appeared live

Changes in v8:
- smc_diag.c: use smp_load_acquire(&sk->sk_state) to prevent
  speculative load reordering on weakly ordered CPUs (such as arm64)
  during handshake abort fallback
- af_smc.c: pair with smp_store_release(&sk->sk_state, SMC_ACTIVE)
  when transitioning out of SMC_INIT
- smc_diag.c: copy cached link->ibname instead of chasing
  link->smcibdev->ibdev->name to prevent NULL pointer dereference / UAF
  if __smcr_link_clear() zeroes the link during link failover

Changes in v7:
- no code changes; commit message only
- document the SMC_CLOSED leg of the early-exit guard and the rationale
  that smcss already skips CLOSED sockets on the userspace side; add
  a Fixes tag for ae2be35cbed2 for the smc_conn_kill() hunk since
  smcd_buf_detach() was introduced by that commit

Changes in v6:
- smc_diag.c: inline sk->sk_state !=3D SMC_INIT into the else-if
  condition so conn->lgr->is_smcd is never loaded for SMC_INIT sockets;
  retain the SMC_INIT || SMC_CLOSED early-exit guard and out: label
  from v5 to defensively skip the CONNINFO/LGRINFO/DMBINFO blocks for
  sockets with no live connection
- smc_close.c: remove the unconditional unhash from the top of
  smc_close_active_abort(); place it scoped immediately before each of
  the two smc_conn_free() calls in the PEERCLOSEWAIT and PROCESSABORT
  branches, and before smc_conn_free() in smc_close_passive_work();
  this avoids prematurely hiding live SMC_ACTIVE/APPCLOSEWAIT sockets
  from smcss
- smc_core.c: unhash at the top of smc_conn_kill(), before
  smcd_buf_detach(), so the socket is off the hash table before
  conn->sndbuf_desc is freed on the dmb_nocopy path

Changes in v5:
- guard conn/lgr/lnk blocks in __smc_diag_dump() with an
  (SMC_INIT || SMC_CLOSED) state check placed after the
  SMC_DIAG_FALLBACK nla_put; SMC_INIT can coexist with fallback
  (smc_sendmsg() MSG_FASTOPEN path), so the guard must not suppress
  the fallback reason

Changes in v4:
- dropped smc_conn_unhash() wrapper, conn->unhashed flag, and all
  changes to af_smc.c, smc.h, smc_core.c and smc_core.h;
  smc_unhash_sk() is already idempotent via sk_hashed(), so direct
  calls at the two teardown sites in smc_close.c are sufficient
- dropped the __smc_release() hunk: it needs no change since the
  subsequent unhash there is already a safe no-op
- fixed premature-unhash issue present in v3: smc_conn_free() must not
  unhash because smc_conn_abort() calls it before
  smc_switch_to_fallback() in both smc_listen_decline() and
  smc_connect_rdma() error paths; unhashing there would make live
  fallback sockets invisible to smcss
- likewise, the ISM/RDMA retry loops call smc_conn_abort() on a failed
  attempt and then smc_conn_create() on the next device; unhashing in
  smc_conn_free() would permanently hide the established connection from
  smc_diag since smc_conn_create() does not re-hash the socket

Changes in v3:
- redesigned as a single patch; dropped the lgr_lnk_lock spinlock
  approach and the 2-patch split

Changes in v2:
- split into a 2-patch series; patch 1/2 adds per-connection
  lgr_lnk_lock infrastructure to smc_core, patch 2/2 fixes the diag
  dump path using it
