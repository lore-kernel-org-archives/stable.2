igb does not support XDP multi-buffer: igb_xdp_setup() only accepts an
MTU whose frame fits in one Rx buffer, and the XDP program only sees
the first buffer of a frame. The maximum receive length is not limited
accordingly, though. RLPML is only lowered when the frame fits a
build_skb buffer on systems with PAGE_SIZE < 8192 and no VFs. Otherwise
the MAC still accepts frames of up to MAX_JUMBO_FRAME_SIZE while XDP is
attached, for example at MTU 3000 on 3 KiB buffers, and at any MTU when
PAGE_SIZE >= 8192. With VFs allocated, RLPML always stays at
MAX_JUMBO_FRAME_SIZE and the PF pool limit in VMOLR is only lowered for
frames that fit a build_skb buffer, so the same happens at MTU 3000.

Such frames span several descriptors. When the program does not return
XDP_PASS for the first buffer, no skb is built, and igb_clean_rx_irq()
handles the next buffer of the same frame as the start of a new frame:
it runs the program on it and may pass it to the stack as a bogus frame
made from the middle of the original payload.

Limit the receive length to the configured maximum frame size while XDP
is attached: in RLPML when no VFs are allocated, and in the PF pool's
VMOLR otherwise, as RLPML then has to stay large for the VFs. Larger
frames are dropped by the MAC.

Also make sure that the limit holds:

- Leave room for the inline Rx timestamp header when checking that the
  frame fits in one Rx buffer, on XDP setup and on MTU change, where the
  limit is the hardware buffer size. This lowers the largest MTU
  accepted with XDP by 16 bytes: from 3046 to 3030 on 3 KiB buffers,
  and from 2022 to 2006 with legacy-rx or PAGE_SIZE >= 8192. Setups that
  use XDP at those MTUs will have to lower the MTU. The build_skb frame
  limit used with 2 KiB buffers is kept, so XDP still attaches up to MTU
  1510 on x86. The header is only prepended by 82580 and later MACs; the
  room is reserved on all MACs for simplicity.
- Base that check on the buffer size that igb_set_rx_buffer_len() will
  select, not on the ring flags, which are only updated when the rings
  are configured and can be stale on an interface that is down. As a
  result, an MTU change with XDP attached can now also move from 2 KiB
  to 3 KiB buffers. The check is skipped when XDP is removed.
- Refuse XDP while rx-all is enabled, and keep rx-all off while XDP is
  attached, as the MAC then also stores frames longer than RLPML. If
  rx-all was requested meanwhile, it is turned on when XDP is removed.
- Refuse to change the legacy-rx private flag while XDP is attached, as
  that changes the Rx buffer size without checking it against the MTU.
- Program both limits from igb_configure(), which runs when the
  interface is (re)configured, before Rx is enabled, and no longer from
  igb_set_rx_mode(), which can also run without RTNL, for example on an
  IPv6 multicast join or a VF mailbox request. Otherwise such a call
  during an XDP removal or an MTU change could apply the new limit while
  the rings still use the old buffers.
  Attaching or removing an XDP program on a running interface goes
  through igb_close() and igb_open(), and an MTU change through
  igb_down() and igb_up(), so igb_configure() runs in both cases.
  igb_set_rx_mode() still updates other bits of the PF pool's VMOLR. The
  core calls it under the address lock, so the limit is changed under
  that lock. The VF mailbox path calls it from the interrupt handler
  without the lock, but interrupts are masked while igb_configure()
  runs.

This follows the same approach as the igc fix that limits RLPML while
XDP is attached. igb_set_rx_mode() does not touch VMOLR on i354, but
i354 can have VFs, and then the PF pool limit is the only one. So it is
also written on i354 when VFs are allocated, with or without XDP.

Tested on an I350 at MTU 3000 with Rx timestamping on and xdp-filter
dropping all IPv4 from the peer: 8242-byte frames are now dropped by the
MAC (rx_long_length_errors), instead of their last two buffers being
delivered as a separate frame. XDP attach at MTU 1500 and 3030 still
works, at MTU 3046 it is refused, as is an MTU change from 3030 to 3046
with XDP attached; an MTU change from 1500 to 3000 with XDP attached
now works. With XDP attached, rx-all stays off and the legacy-rx flag
cannot be changed. XDP attach is refused with rx-all on, and at MTU
3000 with legacy-rx on, also when the flag was set while the interface
was down. MTU changes between 1500 and 3000 with XDP attached, while
the peer sent 3000-byte zero-payload frames, let no frame through as a
separate frame.

With two VFs allocated, the same frames are counted by the MAC but
dropped by the PF pool limit in VMOLR before they reach the Rx queue;
without this patch their last two buffers are again delivered as a
separate frame. Read back from the registers, RLPML then stays at 9728
and the PF pool limit is 3026 at MTU 3000 and 1526 at MTU 1500 with XDP
attached. In repeated runs of about 200 MTU changes each, the limit was
right after every change, except for one read in one run, where the
value was not logged; eight reruns showed no mismatch.

The i354 path was checked with the driver built so that the I350 takes
the i354 branches for VMOLR. With two VFs and XDP attached, the PF pool
limit kept its old value of 9728 when the VMOLR write was skipped on
i354, and read back as 3026 at MTU 3000 and 1526 at MTU 1500 with this
patch. Only the registers were checked; I have no i354 to test on.
