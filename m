[ Upstream commit 4c7d1b4cd75a775326e6802608440f7642284ea6 ]

hsmp_get_uid() passed the device UID directly to kstrtou16(uid + 2)
without checking it.  A NULL UID or one shorter than three characters
would dereference a NULL pointer or read past the end of the string.

Reject such UIDs with -EINVAL before stripping the "ID" prefix.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

This checkout is **Linux 7.3.0-rc4** (`v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37`). The
analysis is whether `4c7d1b4cd75a7` (“Validate ACPI UID before parsing
socket index”) is a technically sound stable backport for this tree’s
HSMP ACPI driver.

## Phase 1: Commit message forensics

**Step 1.1 — Subject**
- Record: `[platform/x86/amd/hsmp] [Validate] Reject NULL/short ACPI
  UIDs before `kstrtou16(uid + 2)``

**Step 1.2 — Tags**
- Record:
  - `Signed-off-by: Muralidhara M K <muralidhara.mk@amd.com>` (author;
    AMD HSMP contributor)
  - `Reviewed-by: Ilpo Järvinen <ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com>` (pdx86
    maintainer)
  - `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260625123337.886435-3-
    muralidhara.mk@amd.com` (earlier series)
  - `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260629155634.1807598-2-
    muralidhara.mk@amd.com` (applied v2 1/4)
  - `Signed-off-by: Ilpo Järvinen <ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com>`
    (maintainer apply)
  - No `Fixes:`, no `Reported-by:`, no `Cc: stable` (absence is expected
    for this review)
  - Ignore any pipeline `Signed-off-by: Sasha Levin` / `[Upstream commit
    ...]` markers

**Step 1.3 — Body**
- Record: Bug = `hsmp_get_uid()` calls `kstrtou16(uid + 2)` with no
  check. Symptom = NULL deref if UID is NULL, or read past the string if
  UID is shorter than three characters. Root cause = missing validation
  before stripping the `"ID"` prefix. No version range or reproducer in
  the message.

**Step 1.4 — Hidden bug fix?**
- Record: Not hidden. It is an explicit memory-safety check. The series
  cover letter calls it “ACPI input hardening,” which is still a real
  NULL/OOB fix, not style cleanup.

## Phase 2: Diff analysis

**Step 2.1 — Inventory**
- Record: One file, `drivers/platform/x86/amd/hsmp/acpi.c`, **+3**
  (include + 2-line check). Function: `hsmp_get_uid()`. Scope: single-
  file surgical fix.

**Step 2.2 — Code flow**
- Record: Before: `uid = acpi_device_uid(ACPI_COMPANION(dev)); return
  kstrtou16(uid + 2, 10, sock_ind);`
  After: if `uid` is NULL or `strlen(uid) < 3`, return `-EINVAL`; else
  same parse.
  Path: ACPI HSMP probe / `init_acpi()`, not a hot path.

**Step 2.3 — Bug mechanism**
- Record: **NULL pointer dereference + out-of-bounds string read.**
  - `acpi_device` is `kzalloc`’d (`drivers/acpi/scan.c`), so
    `pnp.unique_id` starts NULL.
  - `unique_id` is only set when `ACPI_VALID_UID` (`kstrdup` of `_UID`).
    Missing `_UID`, or `kstrdup` failure, leaves NULL.
  - `acpi_device_uid()` is `#define acpi_device_uid(d)
    ((d)->pnp.unique_id)` — can be NULL.
  - `kstrtou16()` → `_parse_integer_fixup_radix()` reads `s[0]`
    immediately. NULL `uid` is a kernel oops.
  - UID shorter than 2 characters (`"0"`, `"1"`, `""`) makes `uid + 2`
    past the NUL; `kstrtou*` walks until NUL → heap overread.
  - `strlen == 2` (`"ID"`) is conservatively rejected; `kstrtou16("")`
    would have returned `-EINVAL` anyway.

**Step 2.4 — Fix quality**
- Record: Obviously correct and minimal. Valid `"ID00"`/`"ID01"` UIDs
  are unchanged. Regression risk is very low: probe fails with `-EINVAL`
  instead of oopsing. No API/locking/refcount change. Does not check the
  `"ID"` prefix itself; that is leftover firmware-format assumption, not
  a regression.

## Phase 3: Git history

**Step 3.1 — Blame**
- Record: Buggy `kstrtou16(uid + 2)` came from `ba8dcff0e9c4f` (“Add
  support for ACPI based probing”, Suma Hegde, 2024-01-06). Landed in
  **v6.9** (in v6.9, not in v6.8). Later moved unchanged in
  `969f915473d8c` (v6.13 directory split). Present for many releases.

**Step 3.2 — Fixes: tag**
- Record: None. Introducer is `ba8dcff0e9c4f`, ancestor of this HEAD.

**Step 3.3 — File history**
- Record: Nearby commits are later HSMP hardening (`0d7a266449453` _DSD
  count, `e5e511f5d9e05` data-plane gate). This patch is **standalone**;
  it does not need those.

**Step 3.4 — Author**
- Record: Muralidhara M K is a regular AMD HSMP author. Reviewed and
  applied by pdx86 maintainer Ilpo Järvinen.

**Step 3.5 — Dependencies**
- Record: None. Only uses existing `acpi_device_uid`, `strlen`,
  `kstrtou16`. Can apply by itself to any tree that has
  `hsmp_get_uid()`.

## Phase 4: Mailing list / external

**Step 4.1 — Original discussion**
- Record: `b4 dig -c 4c7d1b4cd75a7` matched
  https://patch.msgid.link/20260629155634.1807598-2-
  muralidhara.mk@amd.com
  Revisions: included in a larger 2026-06-25 series, then **v1 1/4**
  (2026-06-29) and **v2 1/4** of “ACPI input hardening and data-plane
  readiness gating.” Applied version is v2 1/4. No NAKs. Cover letter:
  Patches 1–2 validate ACPI input; this one is the UID check. Ilpo
  applied the series to `review-ilpo-next` and noted fixes go via for-
  next unless they are current-rc regressions — so not treated as a hot
  -rc regression, but still accepted as a real fix. No `Cc: stable` in
  the thread.

**Step 4.2 — Recipients (`b4 dig -w`)**
- Record: Ilpo Järvinen, `platform-driver-x86@vger.kernel.org`, `linux-
  kernel@vger.kernel.org`. Right maintainer and list.

**Step 4.3 — Bug report**
- Record: No syzbot/bugzilla/`Reported-by`. Bug is described from code
  review, not a user crash dump.

**Step 4.4 — Series**
- Record: v2 1/4 is self-contained. Later patches ( _DSD bounds, device
  threading, readiness gate) are separate bugs. This one does not need
  them.

**Step 4.5 — Stable list**
- Record: lore.kernel.org returned 403 via WebFetch. Thread mbox from
  `b4 dig -m` has **no** stable discussion. UNVERIFIED whether it was
  later requested on stable@.

## Phase 5: Semantic / call graph

**Step 5.1 — Functions**
- Record: `hsmp_get_uid()` only.

**Step 5.2 — Callers**
- Record: Only `init_acpi()` → `hsmp_acpi_probe()`
  (`platform_driver.probe`). Probe/init context, one call site.

**Step 5.3 — Callees**
- Record: `ACPI_COMPANION()`, `acpi_device_uid()`, `strlen()`,
  `kstrtou16()`.

**Step 5.4 — Reachability**
- Record: Triggered when `CONFIG_AMD_HSMP_ACPI` probes HID
  `ACPI_HSMP_DEVICE_HID` (AMD EPYC/MI300A HSMP ACPI). Not a syscall.
  Unprivileged users cannot inject ACPI `_UID`. Firmware with
  missing/short `_UID` (or numeric `_UID` like `"0"`) oopses at probe
  instead of failing the driver.

**Step 5.5 — Similar patterns**
- Record: Core ACPI already NULL-checks UID in
  `acpi_dev_uid_to_integer()` (`if (!uid) return -ENODATA`). HSMP was
  missing that same guard.

## Phase 6: This tree

**Step 6.1 — Buggy code here?**
- Record: Yes. File and `hsmp_get_uid()` exist. The 2-line check is
  already present at lines 97–98 because this commit **is an ancestor of
  HEAD**. Introduced v6.9; this is 7.3-rc4, so the driver and the bug
  (pre-fix) belong to this lineage.

**Step 6.2 — Backport difficulty**
- Record: Clean apply. `hsmp_get_uid()` body has been stable since v6.9
  aside from this check. This 7.3 tree already has extra includes from
  later commits; the three-line change itself is trivial.

**Step 6.3 — Other fix already here?**
- Record: This *is* the fix. No alternate UID validation exists besides
  these two lines.

## Phase 7: Subsystem

**Step 7.1**
- Record: `drivers/platform/x86/amd/hsmp` — AMD Host System Management
  Port. **PERIPHERAL / IMPORTANT for AMD server users**, not core
  mm/vfs. Used on EPYC and MI300A.

**Step 7.2**
- Record: Actively maintained (many 2026 HSMP commits by Muralidhara).
  Driver itself is mature since v6.9.

## Phase 8: Impact and risk

**Step 8.1 — Who**
- Record: Config- and firmware-specific: `CONFIG_AMD_HSMP_ACPI` on AMD
  servers whose BIOS exposes the HSMP ACPI object.

**Step 8.2 — Trigger**
- Record: Driver probe. Common on matching hardware with **correct**
  `"IDxx"` UID (then the new check is a no-op). Crash only if `_UID` is
  missing, empty, or shorter than 3 characters. Not a userspace trigger.
  Realistic for incomplete ACPI (VMs, BIOS bugs, numeric `_UID`).

**Step 8.3 — Failure mode**
- Record: Kernel oops on NULL deref or KASAN-class OOB read during
  probe. **Severity: HIGH** (crash). Not data corruption. Not a local
  privilege-escalation path by itself.

**Step 8.4 — Risk/benefit**
- Record: Benefit: prevent oops, fail probe cleanly. Risk: very low (3
  lines, error path only, valid firmware unchanged). Ratio strongly
  favors applying it.

## Phase 9: Synthesis

**Evidence FOR**
- Real NULL deref and string OOB, confirmed in `kstrtox` and ACPI UID
  init.
- 3-line, obviously correct check; same pattern as
  `acpi_dev_uid_to_integer()`.
- Reviewed and applied by the pdx86 maintainer.
- Standalone; no series dependencies.
- Driver and buggy code exist in this tree (since v6.9).
- Oops during probe is worse than `-EINVAL` probe failure.

**Evidence AGAINST**
- No user/`syzbot` report; found by review, framed as hardening.
- Trigger needs bad/non-spec `_UID`; production AMD BIOS should use
  `ID00`/`ID01`.
- Peripheral driver, not core.
- Maintainer routed it through for-next, not as an urgent -rc
  regression.

**Unresolved**
- Could not fetch lore.kernel.org HTML (403); used `b4 dig` mbox
  instead.
- No stable@ thread found in that mbox.

**Stable rules**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — 2-line guard; W=1/checkpatch
   per cover letter; maintainer Reviewed-by.
2. Real user-visible bug? **PASS** — oops/OOB on missing or short
   `_UID`.
3. Important (crash/security/corruption)? **PASS** — probe-time kernel
   oops; HIGH, not theoretical UAF in a hot path.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — +3 lines, one function.
5. No new features/APIs? **PASS**.
6. Applies to this tree? **PASS** — `hsmp_get_uid()` is here; change is
   trivial.

**Exception category:** none required; this is a normal small crash-
prevention fix.

This is a surgical memory-safety check in an existing driver. It does
not add features, does not need later series patches, and turns a
firmware-table oops into a failed probe. That meets stable criteria for
this tree.
