The patch titled
     Subject: mm/madvise: zap markers from guard regions
has been added to the -mm mm-new branch.  Its filename is
     mm-madvise-zap-markers-from-guard-regions.patch

This patch will shortly appear at
     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/25-new.git/tree/patches/mm-madvise-zap-markers-from-guard-regions.patch

This patch will later appear in the mm-new branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Note, mm-new is a provisional staging ground for work-in-progress
patches, and acceptance into mm-new is a notification for others take
notice and to finish up reviews.  Please do not hesitate to respond to
review feedback and post updated versions to replace or incrementally
fixup patches in mm-new.

The mm-new branch of mm.git is not included in linux-next

If a few days of testing in mm-new is successful, the patch will me moved
into mm.git's mm-unstable branch, which is included in linux-next

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/process/submit-checklist.rst when testing your code ***

The -mm tree is included into linux-next via various
branches at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm
and is updated there most days

Subject: mm/madvise: zap markers from guard regions
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 2026 21:04:45 +0000

In order to establish guard regions, guard markers are installed in the
page tables of a mapped VMA.

However, problems arise when one tries to combine this with registering a
VMA for userfaultfd, as such operations may themselves need to install page
table markers such as uffd-wp.

When the installation is attempted the guard marker prevents these markers
being applied, which can lead to unexpected results (especially if the
guard regions are later removed.)

This is especially problematic because guard region installation causes the
regions to be zapped first, meaning that the removal of userfaultfd-tracked
ranges will not be logged in this case.

Additionally, the uffd-wp page table marker will be propagated regardless
for file-backed mappings as the zap being performed does not clear these
markers.

This is problematic, as it can cause repeated failure to install guard
markers resulting in an infinite loop.

Therefore, update guard region installation to invoke the zap with the
ZAP_FLAG_DROP_MARKER flag applied.

Both before and after this change, uffd remove events will not trigger on
guard region installation, nor will write protect state be propagated after
guard region removal.

This makes sense as conceptually, guard regions mark a part of a VMA as
effectively unmapped at the page table level, and removing the markers is
like mapping the VMA again, over which operation uffd markers would in any
case be lost.

A survey of open source users indicates nobody is relying on installing
guard regions in uffd-armed VMAs. Software including glibc, android,
tcmalloc and CRIU were checked.

This change means that any already established guard regions are removed on
zap. These will be overwritten with the newly installed guard markers on
success.

However, if this fails for some reason (fatal signal likely the only
reasonable cause), guard regions may remain removed, and concurrent faults
may succeed in the interim in the range.

Since the installation failing guarantees nothing about the range being
installed into, and since success overwrites with guard markers, this isn't
an issue.

Since MADV_DONTNEED does something similar, abstract the zapping to
zap_range() and call it from both places.
