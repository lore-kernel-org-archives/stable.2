Subject: [PATCH v3 08/24] sched/deadline: Release the bandwidth of a task that leaves the class asleep

A task that leaves SCHED_DEADLINE while it is not queued, asleep or
stopped, keeps its bandwidth in the root domain's total_bw for good:

 - switched_from_dl() hands the release to task_non_contending() for a
   queued task alone;
 - for one that is not queued, it takes the bandwidth off the
   runqueue's running_bw and this_bw, and nothing takes it off
   total_bw;
 - the inactive timer is the one other path that does, and it is not
   armed: the task never ran as SCHED_DEADLINE, or the timer fired
   while it still was, taking running_bw alone.

Repeated, it fills total_bw up to the admission cap, after which
sched_setattr(SCHED_DEADLINE) and the offlining of a CPU fail with
EBUSY.

Release it in switched_from_dl() where the task is not queued and no
inactive timer is pending, for a task with parameters of its own, not
special: a task deboosted from priority inheritance with no parameters
of its own, and a special one (SCHED_FLAG_SUGOV), have no bandwidth in
total_bw. Then clear its bandwidth, once sub_rq_bw(), which reads it, is
done: every path that would release it again takes a dl_bw of 0. Kept,
it would make the task one with bandwidth to task_contending() and
task_non_contending() once priority inheritance boosts it into the
class, and a deboost while it sleeps would release it a second time. So
would the inactive timer's handler when it runs late, dl_non_contending
cleared under it by migrate_task_rq_dl(): it finds the task out of the
class. A test of hrtimer_active() would not tell that handler apart: it
stays true after the handler returns, until the hrtimer code clears its
running state, and the bandwidth of a task switched out meanwhile would
never be released.

With the bandwidth goes the state of the period the task was in, as
where inactive_task_timer() resets it: its 0-lag time is past, a return
to the class starts a period anew, and a throttle left behind would hold
a returning task until the old timer fires. The parameters themselves,
dl_runtime, dl_deadline and dl_period, stay, because the task may still
be the donor of a priority inheritance boost: rt_mutex_adjust_pi() walks
the chain and deboosts the owner after the runqueue lock of the policy
change is dropped, and until it does, a replenishment of that owner,
which update_curr_dl_se() does at once for a boosted entity, would run
replenish_dl_entity() on a donor whose dl_runtime and dl_period are 0.
It would warn and then never leave

	while (dl_se->runtime <= 0) {
		dl_se->deadline += pi_of(dl_se)->dl_period;
		dl_se->runtime += pi_of(dl_se)->dl_runtime;
	}

with the runqueue lock held and interrupts off. __setparam_dl() sets
the parameters anew if the task comes back, and the inactive timer of a
boost into the class resets them if it does not.

The leak was reported by Tejun Heo, and first fixed by Juri Lelli's
"sched/deadline: Fix total_bw leak when switching away from
SCHED_DEADLINE while !queued", since dropped from tip, which released
for every task on this path and kept the bandwidth: the double release
of a boosted task is the pi_former_owner_asleep case of the
deadline_bw_test selftest added later in this series, in a one-CPU
partition with room, the waiter of its second round refused as a
deadline task, total_bw having wrapped.

The donor window was found by the Sashiko AI review of the first
posting of this series, and shown with a kernel carrying mdelay(20)
before rt_mutex_adjust_pi() to widen it: a deadline task blocks on a
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT mutex with its runtime unspent, and is switched to
SCHED_OTHER while the owner it boosts spins. Clearing the parameters
there, that kernel warns in replenish_dl_entity() and stops, on round 4
and round 3 of two 8-CPU VMs; keeping them, both go through their eight
rounds.
