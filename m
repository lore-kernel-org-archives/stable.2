This could lead to stale value on failed retries. is_smcd is only
assigned on the success path of smc_conn_create(). Take a listen side
ISM v2 attempt that succeeds and then aborts, followed by an SMC-R
attempt whose smc_conn_create() fails before reaching this line. If the
socket then closes without falling back, it reports SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCD
for an SMC-R attempt. This is cosmetic, but you could clear it at the
start of smc_conn_create().

I see that Checkpatch throws 6 warnings.
Otherwise Patch looks good to me.
