Subject: mm/hugetlb: fix subpool minimum reservation rollback
Date: Mon, 7 Sep 2026 21:20:55 +0800

When a reservation request is partially covered by a subpool minimum and
the remaining global reservation fails, the error path first calls
hugepage_subpool_put_pages() for the subpool-backed portion.  It removes
the failed global portion from used_hpages only afterwards.

hugepage_subpool_put_pages() uses used_hpages to decide whether rsv_hpages
should be restored.  Since used_hpages still includes the global portion,
it can remain at or above min_hpages and prevent that restoration.  It
then reports the subpool reservation as releasable, causing
hugetlb_acct_memory() to incorrectly decrement h->resv_huge_pages.

This was reproduced with four 2 MB huge pages and a hugetlbfs mount with
size=10M,min_size=8M.  After a successful three-page reservation, a
two-page reservation which needed one subpool page and one global page
failed with -ENOMEM.  HugePages_Rsvd incorrectly dropped from four to
three even though the subpool minimum was still four pages.

Roll back the failed global portion from used_hpages first, so that
hugepage_subpool_put_pages() evaluates the minimum reservation against the
current usage and returns the correct global adjustment.
