[ Upstream commit da3a98c941753255418616d249e5b40db0927c26 ]

ipaq_micro_str() decodes a UTF-16LE string into an ASCII string.
It copies characters to a stack buffer retstr, but fails to
null-terminate it. When kstrdup() is called on retstr, it can read past
the buffer into uninitialized stack memory, potentially leaking stack
contents.

Fix this by initializing retstr to zero.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

The local tree is **v7.3-rc4** (`7.3.0-rc4`). The bug is in
`ipaq_micro_str()`: it copies UTF-16LE bytes into an uninitialized
256-byte stack buffer and then `kstrdup()`/`strlen()` can walk off the
end of that buffer. That is a real out-of-bounds stack read and a
kernel-stack leak into dmesg, introduced in 2014, with a one-line zero-
init fix that applies here with no prerequisites.

===============================================================
PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS
===============================================================

Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE
Record: **[mfd / ipaq-micro] [Fix] out-of-bounds stack read in
ipaq_micro_str**
- Subsystem prefix: `mfd: ipaq-micro:`
- Action verb: **Fix** (explicit bug-fix language)
- Claimed intent: stop `ipaq_micro_str()` from reading past a stack
  buffer

Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS
Record:
- **Reported-by:** `sashiko-bot@kernel.org` (automated analysis bot, not
  syzbot, not a user crash report)
- **Assisted-by:** `Antigravity:gemini-3.5-flash` (LLM-assisted)
- **Signed-off-by:** Dmitry Torokhov (author)
- **Link:** https://patch.msgid.link/aintJF4X5tWDW-Ej@google.com
- **Signed-off-by:** Lee Jones (MFD maintainer)
- **No Fixes:** tag (expected for this review pipeline)
- **No Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org** (expected; not treated as a
  negative)
- **No Tested-by / Reviewed-by / Acked-by**
- No Sasha Levin SOB and no `[Upstream commit ...]` marker on the commit
  itself

Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT
Record:
- **Bug:** `ipaq_micro_str()` decodes UTF-16LE into ASCII in stack
  buffer `retstr` and never NUL-terminates it.
- **Symptom/failure mode:** `kstrdup(retstr)` uses `strlen()`, which can
  read past `retstr` into uninitialized stack, **leaking stack
  contents**.
- **Version information:** none in the message.
- **Root cause (author):** missing terminator on a stack buffer before a
  C-string API.

Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES
Record: **Not a hidden fix.** Subject and body state an OOB read / stack
leak. The one-line zero-init matches that claim.

===============================================================
PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS - LINE BY LINE
===============================================================

Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES
Record:
- **File:** `drivers/mfd/ipaq-micro.c` — 1 insertion, 1 deletion
- **Function:** `ipaq_micro_str()`
- **Scope:** single-file, single-line surgical fix

Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE
Record:
- **Before:** `char retstr[256];` is uninitialized. Loop writes `len/2`
  ASCII bytes at `retstr[0 .. len/2-1]` and never writes a terminator.
  `kstrdup(retstr)` calls `strlen()` (verified in `mm/util.c`).
- **After:** `char retstr[256] = { 0 };` zero-fills the buffer, so the
  first unused byte is NUL and `kstrdup` stays inside the array.
- **Path:** `__init` probe dump only (`ipaq_micro_eeprom_dump()` →
  `ipaq_micro_str()`), not a hot path.

Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM
Record:
- **Categories:** uninitialized data **and** out-of-bounds stack read;
  possible kernel-stack leak to dmesg.
- **Mechanism:** C-string API on a non-terminated stack buffer. Callers
  pass `len` of 10/40/20/10, so 5–20 bytes are written and 236–251 bytes
  stay uninitialized. If those leftover bytes contain no NUL, `strlen()`
  reads **past** the 256-byte array.
- **Fix:** full zero-init; `len` is `u8` so `len/2 <= 127`, always room
  for a terminator.

Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY
Record:
- **Quality:** obviously correct. Equivalent to `retstr[i] = '\0'` after
  the loop; zero-init is simpler and covers every `len`.
- **Regression risk:** very low. Only this helper; no locking, APIs, or
  control-flow change. Extra zeros cannot make a well-formed EEPROM
  string worse; they only stop the over-read.
- **Red flags:** none (1 line, one driver, no public API).

===============================================================
PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION
===============================================================

Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES
Record:
- **Buggy function introduced by:** `dcc21cc09e3c22` — “mfd: Add driver
  for Atmel Microcontroller on iPaq h3xxx” (Linus Walleij, 2014-04-03;
  merged 2014-06-03).
- **First appeared:** `v3.16-rc1` (`git describe --contains
  dcc21cc09e3c22` → `v3.16-rc1~82^2~6^2~20`).
- The `char retstr[256];` / `kstrdup` pattern was unchanged from
  introduction until this fix.

Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG
Record: **No Fixes: tag.** Introducer identified by blame:
`dcc21cc09e3c22`, present in this tree (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`
not needed for HEAD history; the file and function are here).

Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES
Record:
- Recent file commits are style/helpers (`str_enable_disable`, `%*ph`,
  missing `break`, etc.), not a competing terminator fix.
- **Standalone**, not `patch X/Y`. No follow-up on this helper after
  `da3a98c941753`.

Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS
Record:
- Author **Dmitry Torokhov** is a long-time input/MFD contributor, not
  the iPAQ driver original author.
- Nearby MFD work is unrelated (rohm, ucb1x00, mt6397). This looks like
  a bot-found one-off, not a series.

Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS
Record:
- **No dependencies.** Changes only `char retstr[256];` → `= { 0 }`.
  Pre-fix function in this tree’s parent of the fix is identical to the
  candidate hunk. **Applies standalone.**

===============================================================
PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH
===============================================================

Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION
Record:
- **b4 dig -c da3a98c941753:** https://patch.msgid.link/aintJF4X5tWDW-
  Ej@google.com
- **b4 dig -a:** single **v1** only (2026-06-10); no v2/v3.
- Thread (saved via `b4 dig -m`): Dmitry’s patch + Lee Jones “Applied,
  thanks!” (2026-06-18). **No NAK, no stable nomination, no risk
  discussion.**
- lore.kernel.org WebFetch returned **403**; discussion recovered from
  the mbox instead.

Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH
Record: **b4 dig -w** original recipients: Dmitry Torokhov, **Lee
Jones** (`lee@kernel.org`, MFD maintainer), `linux-
kernel@vger.kernel.org`. Maintainer applied it. No other review mail in
the thread.

Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT
Record: Reporter is **sashiko-bot**, not syzbot. No bugzilla/syzkaller
link. No user “I hit this on hardware” report found in the thread.
Severity from the author: stack OOB + possible stack leak.

Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES
Record: **Standalone v1.** Not part of a multi-patch series.

Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY
Record: **UNVERIFIED** for lore.kernel.org/stable (HTTP 403). No stable
discussion in the captured mbox.

===============================================================
PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
===============================================================

Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS IN THE DIFF
Record: **`ipaq_micro_str()`** only.

Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS
Record: (semcode unavailable; `git grep` / file read)
- Only caller: `ipaq_micro_eeprom_dump()` with `(dump, 10)`, `(dump+10,
  40)`, `(dump+50, 20)`, `(dump+70, 10)`.
- That dump is `__init` and is called from **`micro_probe()`** after MFD
  cells are added.
- Results go to `dev_info()` and, for the serial-number string,
  `add_device_randomness()`.

Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES
Record: loop assignment; **`kstrdup()`** → `strlen()` + `kmalloc` +
`memcpy` (`mm/util.c`). That is what turns missing NUL into an over-read
and a heap copy of whatever `strlen` walked.

Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN
Record:
- `builtin_platform_driver_probe(..., micro_probe)` →
  `ipaq_micro_eeprom_dump` → `ipaq_micro_str`.
- **Reachable only when this platform device probes**, i.e. Compaq iPAQ
  h3xxx with `CONFIG_MFD_IPAQ_MICRO` / `SA1100_H3600`.
- Not a syscall-reachable path for unprivileged users on generic
  hardware. Requires that board.

Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS
Record: No other `ipaq_micro_str`-style helper in-tree. Sibling iPAQ
drivers (keys/ts/battery) do not duplicate this decoder.

===============================================================
PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE
===============================================================

Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?
Record:
- **Yes.** File and helper exist. Pre-fix form (`char retstr[256];` +
  `kstrdup`) is in this lineage from `dcc21cc09e3c22` (v3.16) through
  the parent of `da3a98c941753`.
- Current HEAD already contains the zero-init line (commit is an
  ancestor of HEAD). That is **not** used as “already selected for
  stable”; it only confirms the surrounding code is the same.
- Local version: **7.3.0-rc4** / `v7.3-rc4-27-gf0100363d8c37`.

Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS
Record: **Clean apply.** Hunk context (`ipaq_micro_eeprom_read` /
`ipaq_micro_str` / loop / `kstrdup`) is unchanged besides this one
initializer. No refactor of this function in this tree.

Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE
Record: No earlier alternate terminator fix. `3d1c3272a8095` is an
unrelated missing-`break` change.

===============================================================
PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT
===============================================================

Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY
Record:
- **Subsystem:** MFD driver `drivers/mfd/ipaq-micro.c` (Compaq iPAQ
  Atmel companion).
- **Criticality: PERIPHERAL.** `MFD_IPAQ_MICRO` depends on
  `SA1100_H3600` (StrongARM iPAQ H3100/H3600/H3700). `SA1100_H3600` is
  still a real board option (not `UNUSED_BOARD_FILES`, unlike several
  other sa1100 boards).

Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY
Record: **Mature / low churn.** Driver added 2014; later commits are
small cleanups. Bug is long-standing, not a new-subsystem issue.

===============================================================
PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================

Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED
Record: **Platform-specific / config-specific** — only kernels built for
Compaq iPAQ H3xxx (`SA1100_H3600` selects `MFD_IPAQ_MICRO`). Not
universal, not enterprise-default hardware.

Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS
Record:
- **Trigger:** once per boot, in `__init` `micro_probe()`, when the
  microcontroller EEPROM is dumped.
- **How common:** every probe on that hardware; never on other machines.
- **Unprivileged userspace:** cannot trigger this without the device
  (not a syzbot-style syscall bug). If dmesg is readable, leaked stack
  bytes in `dev_info` lines are the exposure.

Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY
Record:
- **Failure mode:** `strlen`/`kstrdup` over-read of stack; copy of extra
  stack bytes into a heap string; print via `dev_info` (kernel log info
  leak); oversized `add_device_randomness()` on the serial path.
  Possible large `kmalloc` if no NUL is found soon; crash only if the
  scan hits an unmapped guard (possible, not demonstrated).
- **Severity: HIGH** for memory safety / info leak on that platform;
  **LOW population**. Not a guaranteed panic on every boot.

Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO
Record:
- **Benefit:** stops a real OOB stack read and stack leak for every iPAQ
  micro probe. Code has been wrong since v3.16.
- **Risk:** very low (one initializer, no behavior change for terminated
  strings).
- **Ratio:** benefit modest in user count, risk near zero. For a 1-line
  memory-safety fix that is obviously correct, that still favors
  inclusion.

===============================================================
PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS
===============================================================

Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE
**FOR backporting to this tree:**
- Real bug: missing NUL + `kstrdup`/`strlen` → OOB stack read; leftover-
  buffer chance of no NUL is high (~35–40% if leftover bytes are
  random), so this is not a purely theoretical race.
- Failure includes kernel-stack contents in dmesg (info leak) and a
  possibly oversized allocation.
- One-line, obviously correct, no new API/feature.
- Present in this tree’s code since v3.16; no missing prerequisites.
- MFD maintainer Lee Jones applied v1 with no objections.
- Matches stable patterns: uninitialized data, OOB, small surgical fix.

**AGAINST:**
- Extremely niche 2000-era PDA; not a core/enterprise path.
- Probe/`__init` only; not a hot-path leak or a syscall UAF.
- Reporter is sashiko-bot + LLM assist, not a hardware user or syzbot
  repro.
- No `Cc: stable` in review (not a negative per pipeline rules).

**UNRESOLVED:**
- Could not query lore.kernel.org/stable (403).
- No runtime crash log; analysis is from code + commit text.

Step 9.2: APPLY THE STABLE RULES CHECKLIST
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — zero-init makes `kstrdup`
   well-defined; maintainer applied it. (No extra Tested-by; correctness
   is visible from the code.)
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — OOB read + stack leak
   on this driver’s probe path. Affected users are iPAQ H3xxx owners
   only, but the bug is real.
3. Important issue? **PASS** — out-of-bounds stack read and kernel-stack
   leak, not a style cleanup. Severity HIGH on that platform, not a core
   panic.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — 1 line, one static helper.
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — same function, same callers,
   no refactor required.

Step 9.3: CHECK FOR EXCEPTION CATEGORIES
Record: **None** (not a device ID, quirk, DT, build, or docs exception).
It qualifies as a normal small memory-safety bug fix.

Step 9.4: MAKE YOUR DECISION
This tree contains the buggy helper and can take the one-line terminator
fix with essentially no regression risk. Niche hardware lowers the user
count; it does not make an OOB stack read + log leak ineligible. The
patch meets the stable-rule checklist for **this** 7.3-rc4 tree.

===============================================================
What the commit solves for this tree
===============================================================
`ipaq_micro_str()` fills a 256-byte stack buffer and then treats it as a
C string. Without a terminator, `kstrdup()` → `strlen()` can read off
the end of `retstr` and copy leftover stack into a heap string that is
printed (`dev_info`) and, for the serial number, passed to
`add_device_randomness()`. Zero-initializing `retstr` terminates the
string inside the array. That is the whole fix.

Risk vs benefit: benefit is limited to Compaq iPAQ H3xxx probe, but the
defect is a genuine memory-safety / info-leak bug present since v3.16.
Risk of the change is negligible. No series, no extra commits, no
backport rework.
