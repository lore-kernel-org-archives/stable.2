Right, iomap_page_mkwrite() doesn't seem to update the PTE entry, it
just records the access. But there's quite a bit of locking taking place
before this recording is done, which we don't do in gem_shmem's
pkf_mkwrite implementation. This brings me back to some question I asked
in another thread where we were discussing another regression
introduced by pfn_mkwrite addition to gem_shmem [1]: do we need to have
the folio locked when recording the mkwrite? If we do, we probably need
to surround the drm_gem_shmem_record_mkwrite() call in
drm_gem_shmem_pfn_mkwrite() with a folio_lock/unlock() sequence.

For the record, the folio_mark_dirty() doc says:

 * The folio may not be truncated while this function is running.
 * Holding the folio lock is sufficient to prevent truncation, but some
 * callers cannot acquire a sleeping lock.  These callers instead hold
 * the page table lock for a page table which contains at least one page
 * in this folio.  Truncation will block on the page table lock as it
 * unmaps pages before removing the folio from its mapping.

I'm really sorry to hijack this thread like that, but now that I have
people with a bit more MM knowledge looking at this stuff, I'm taking
the opportunity to ask all the questions that were left unanswered back
then :-/.

Sure. As long as what we're doing is safe, I'm fine keeping
drm_gem_shmem_pfn_mkwrite() as is and letting the core update the PTE
props. It's just that, after reading all these implementations, I was
skeptical (see the question around folio locking before mark_dirty(),
for instance).

Anyway, thanks for chiming in.
