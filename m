5.15-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>

commit dc1ce45575b3401102568dd60ba8894849d1d64b upstream.

Fix the number of bits in the role, and simplify the explanation of
why several bits or combinations of bits are redundant.
