I'm in favor of this. Just after checking couple of filesystem changes -
won't we be better off by using a generic flag in super_block for this so
that VFS can check for it? Then each filesystem won't have to implement
its own wrapper for simple_fsync(), quota operations, and whatever other
generic operations that need to bail on shutdown filesystem...
