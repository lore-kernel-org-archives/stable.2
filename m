6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Mike Waychison <mike@waychison.com>

commit 691b052139c94ee6640ac39e0b764dd3867897c0 upstream.

blk_time_get_ns() populates the per-plug cached timestamp and then
returns it by re-reading the field:

	if (!plug->cur_ktime) {
		plug->cur_ktime = ktime_get_ns();
		current->flags |= PF_BLOCK_TS;
	}
	return plug->cur_ktime;

This is problematic when the compiler emits the final
"return plug->cur_ktime" as a reload from memory, after PF_BLOCK_TS has
already been set.

Since the cached timestamp is now invalidated from finish_task_switch()
(fad156c2af22 "block: invalidate cached plug timestamp after task
switch"), a task preempted between setting PF_BLOCK_TS and that reload
has plug->cur_ktime zeroed by blk_plug_invalidate_ts() when it is
scheduled back in.  The reload then returns 0.

A 0 handed back here is stored as a start timestamp -- e.g.
blk_account_io_start() writes it to rq->start_time_ns -- and later
subtracted from "now".  blk_account_io_done() then adds (now - 0), i.e.
roughly the system uptime, to the per-group nsecs[] counters.  On an
otherwise idle, healthy device this appears as sudden ~uptime-sized jumps
in the diskstats time fields (write_ticks/discard_ticks/time_in_queue).

The solution is to be explicit in our reads and writes to this field
that is preemption volatile.  We also add a barrier() to ensure that any
setting of PF_BLOCK_TS is ordered to happen after the cur_ktime update.

This issue was discovered using AI-assisted kprobes looking for paths
that were leaking zeroed timestamps in a live system, based on the
observation that we were sometimes seeing uptime-sized jumps in kernel
exported counters. This was flagged by NodeDiskIOSaturation
prometheus alerts that started firing on all hosts post 7.1.3 kernel
upgrade, due to node-exporter now exporting a nonsensical
node_disk_io_time_weighted_seconds_total.
