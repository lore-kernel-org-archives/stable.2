The quilt patch titled
     Subject: lib/decompress_bunzip2: fix off-by-one in run-length bounds check
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     lib-decompress_bunzip2-fix-off-by-one-in-run-length-bounds-check.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-nonmm-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: lib/decompress_bunzip2: fix off-by-one in run-length bounds check
Date: Sat, 12 Sep 2026 14:17:35 -0400

The run-length path rejects a block when dbufCount+t equals dbufSize, but
the loop that follows writes exactly t bytes starting at dbufCount, so a
block that fills the buffer exactly is legal.  bzip2 allows it too: its
decompressor bounds a block at 100000 * blockSize100k and checks that
limit per byte appended.  Use > instead of >=.

bzip2's encoder stops filling a block 19 bytes early, so nothing it
produces ever reaches the limit and the bug stays hidden.  Compressors
that use the full block size do reach it: an lbzip2 -9 image whose block
ends on a run fails to decode, and a self-extracting kernel built that way
does not boot.

This code came from busybox, which fixed the same line in 2013 in commit
932e233a491b ("bunzip2: fix off-by-one check").

I ran into this because my system uses lbzip2 as /bin/bzip2 -- a common
thing on Gentoo I believe.  As far as I can tell, anyone using lbzip2
as their system bzip2 would run into this and it's only because it's
very uncommon these days to compress a kernel with bzip2 that no one
has noticed.  I only noticed because I was adding support for various
compression formats on alpha.
