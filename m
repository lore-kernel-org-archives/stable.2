Subject: errseq: don't let errseq_check_and_advance() hide later errors

Patch series "errseq: fix lost writeback errors in
errseq_check_and_advance()".

errseq_check_and_advance() advances the caller's cursor to the value it
tried to store even when its cmpxchg() failed.  If errseq_set() stored a
different errno in the meantime, the cursor holds a value that was never
in the errseq_t.  errseq_set() does not bump the counter while the current
error is unseen, so recording the first errno again recreates exactly that
value, and once another subscriber has marked it seen, the cursor's next
check returns 0.  For fsync() (file->f_wb_err) and syncfs() (sb->s_wb_err)
this means that a writeback error recorded after the previous call
returned is not reported.  The race is rare: it needs two different
errnos, an error recorded while the check runs, and a second subscriber
consuming the value.  There is no user report; it was found with a model
checker.

Patch 1 retries with the value found when the cmpxchg() fails, so the
cursor is only ever advanced to a value that was stored with ERRSEQ_SEEN
set.  Patch 2 adds a KUnit case that races errseq_set() against
errseq_check_and_advance() on two CPUs.

Two behaviour changes are visible to callers, both intended.  When a
writer wins the race, the call now returns the newer errno (still "the
latest error", as documented).  And when two threads race on the same
unserialised cursor (syncfs() does not lock f_sb_err), the loser may now
return 0 where both used to return the error, so each open file
description gets one report.

Dependencies: patch 1 applies to mainline (fd179f8a05be) on its own and
carries Cc: stable.  Patch 2 extends the errseq KUnit suite from commit
b52f5c1605f2 ("lib/tests: add KUnit tests for errseq"), which is only in
mm-nonmm-unstable, so the series is based on mm-nonmm-unstable
(e8d6475e77a7).  Patch 1 could go through mm-hotfixes and patch 2 through
mm-nonmm-unstable.

The bug was found with a TLA+ model of lib/errseq.c checked with TLC.
The patches were prepared with Claude Code (Anthropic), model Claude
Opus 5.5 (claude-opus-5-5).  Testing is described at the Link:.


This patch (of 2):

errseq_check_and_advance() reads the errseq_t, sets ERRSEQ_SEEN with a
cmpxchg() and then advances *since to the value it computed, ignoring
whether the cmpxchg() succeeded. When it fails because errseq_set()
recorded a different error in the meantime, *since ends up holding a
value that was never stored in the errseq_t.

errseq_set() only bumps the counter when ERRSEQ_SEEN is set. So as long
as nobody has seen the new error, recording the original errno again
recreates exactly the old value, and once another subscriber marks it
seen, it is equal to the stale *since. The next check through that
cursor then reports nothing, although -ENOSPC was recorded after the
value that check reported, and -EIO was recorded again after it
returned:

  cursor f                writeback              cursor g
  --------                ---------              --------
                          set(-EIO)
  check_and_advance(&f)
    old = [c, EIO]
                          set(-ENOSPC)
                          -> [c, ENOSPC]
    cmpxchg() fails
    f = [c, EIO, SEEN]
    returns -EIO
                          set(-EIO)
                          -> [c, EIO]
                          (no bump: unseen)
                                                 check_and_advance(&g)
                                                 -> [c, EIO, SEEN]
                                                 returns -EIO
  check_and_advance(&f)
    [c, EIO, SEEN] == f
    returns 0             <- -ENOSPC and the second -EIO are lost

For file->f_wb_err this means that fsync() on one descriptor can return 0
although writeback failed after the previous fsync() on that descriptor
returned, when writeback errors race with fsync() on another descriptor of
the same file.  The same applies to syncfs() through sb->s_wb_err, which
every file on the filesystem shares, and to the ext4 and jbd2 cursors on
the block device mapping.  The kernel-doc promises "Negative errno if one
has been stored, or 0 if no new error has occurred".

Retry with the value found when the cmpxchg() fails, so that *since is
only ever advanced to a value that was actually stored with ERRSEQ_SEEN
set.  Every later errseq_set() then has to bump the counter, and the error
is reported.  The retry loop terminates because each iteration needs a
concurrent update, like the loop in errseq_set().

A TLA+ model of errseq_set() and errseq_check_and_advance(), checked with
the TLC model checker, finds the lost error with the current code; with
this change TLC checks that an error recorded after a check returned is
always reported by the next check (exhaustively for two subscribers with
three checks each, and one writer recording four errors or two writers
recording two each).  The KUnit race test added in the next patch misses
the error in 1-6% of 2 million rounds on 4-CPU UML before this change
(depending on host load), and in none after it.
