Well, it was written in the repetitive LLM style and basically took a
whole page to explain that there's a carry bit, which seems fairly self-
explanatory when unreduced limbs are allowed.  The space is better used
for other details.  If you wrote it by hand, then I'm sorry, but if you
don't want me to think your text is LLM-generated you shouldn't mix it
together with other LLM-generated stuff.

Yes, but that part needed some elaboration, which I added.

Anyway, thanks for finding this.
