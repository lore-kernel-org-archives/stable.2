I have never considered searching to show which patches say they fix the
same commit.  Next time I do a "not all of the patches at once" I will
do that.  As this hasn't come up in the past before, because normally I
can keep on top of the flood, it shouldn't be something we have to
institute very often.

That's because these patches have already been accepted into our tree
and gone through our review process.  Backporting them usually should be
trivial, it's only the minority that are in series and dependant on
others in that series, so this doesn't come up often.

Based on the huge number of patches for stable that show up in -rc1, you
are in the minority :)
