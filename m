Hi Dave,

I reviewed part of the series per commit and tested recovery behaviour 
against the current tip (ecf8aa53, "handle zero length continuation op
headers during recovery"). A few notes and two followup fixes are below.

1. Per-commit observations

  - 5b115b1 ("lift transaction header parsing out of the region
    assembly") says it is behaviour-preserving. That is true for normal
    streams, but not for pre-ad3e3693182b zero-length first fragments:
    those used to be skipped and are rejected until ecf8aa53 restores the
    handling. This is fine within the series, but the changelog may be
    misleading if the refactor is backported alone.

  - In the window [895f4c5, ecf8aa53), a skipped zero-length first
    fragment can leave trans->r_cur_item NULL; the following WAS_CONT
    continuation then dereferences it in xlog_recover_add_to_cont_trans().
    So that window oopses during recovery rather than failing cleanly.

  - In the window [895f4c5, ca71ea1f), a 1-3 byte op header length can
    reach xlog_recover_add_to_trans(), which reads ilf_type/ilf_size from
    a kvmalloc'd buffer shorter than 4 bytes. ASAN catches this as a heap
    over-read. ca71ea1f closes it with the op header length/alignment
    validation.

  - Minor doc/changelog nits: 895f4c5's changelog and the rst say the
    zero-length first fragment case is handled uniformly, but that is only
    true after ecf8aa53. Also, ecf8aa53's doc update says the r_cur_item
    guard is in "Patch 5", but it lands in ecf8aa53 itself.

2. Behaviour testing

We extracted the recovery functions from 857882e, 895f4c5 and ecf8aa53
into a small userspace harness with ASAN, and replayed crafted op record
streams through them: unsplit and split transaction headers, zero-length
first and middle fragments, short fragments, stray WAS_CONT records,
truncated item plus commit, and normal transactions.

A few results:

  - A 3-way transaction header split such as 4+4+8 is silently assembled
    incorrectly at 857882e: the continuation tail-copy path writes the
    middle fragment to the wrong offset, later fragments overwrite it, and
    recovery still succeeds with a corrupted r_theader. 895f4c5 fixes this.

  - A stray WAS_CONT continuation crashes via the empty-queue list walk
    already at 857882e, so that predates this series. ecf8aa53 turns it
    into -EFSCORRUPTED.

  - Zero-length middle continuation fragments now assemble correctly via
    the generic path. The old bespoke transaction-header path rejected
    them.

  - Well-formed streams behaved the same across the three commits.

I can send the full matrix if useful.

3. Two followup fixes

These are against ecf8aa53 and are independent. I am including them
inline for now since the final base is not settled; happy to post proper
patches once it is.

First, xlog_recover_commit_trans() walks r_itemq only and ignores
trans->r_cur_item. If a commit record arrives while an item is still
being rebuilt, that item is silently dropped and the transaction commits
less metadata than the log records describe. A transaction whose only
content never completed can also commit as if it were empty.

Reject commits with a pending r_cur_item. This also catches the
zero-length-opener sentinel case. I did not change XLOG_UNMOUNT_TRANS,
where dropping the partial transaction matches the existing skip
semantics.

         hlist_del_init(&trans->r_list);

Second, xlog_recover_add_to_cont_trans() can grow the region under
assembly with kvrealloc on every continuation record. A corrupt log can
therefore grow a single region without a practical bound, and repeated
realloc/copy makes the work quadratic in the number of fragments.

Add a generic recovery-time cap. No writer-produced region should come
close to this; per-item limits can tighten it later.

Both fixes were checked in the harness: truncated-item+commit and
zero-length-opener+commit now fail cleanly, and continuation streams that
grow past the cap return -EFSCORRUPTED. A region grown to about 64KB
through continuations still assembles and commits normally.

4. Small cleanups

  - xlog_find_item_ops() is a first-match linear scan, so duplicate
    item_type entries would silently shadow later ones. The table is unique
    today, but a debug/build-time check would catch future mistakes.

  - xlog_recover_nregions() warns about a bad number of regions "in inode
    log format", but the helper is now generic for item types without
    ->validate_nregions. The warning should probably be made generic too.

Happy to run these cases through recoveryloop or the logprint-rust fuzzer
once that is ready.

Thanks,
Hongling
