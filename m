Several code paths in the vfio_ap driver failed to free the AQIC
resources — the pinned guest NIB page and the registered guest ISC
used to enable interrupts for a queue — when a queue became
unavailable or when unexpected response codes were returned. This
could cause memory exhaustion and depletion of KVM interrupt
subclass registrations over time with repeated dynamic AP
reconfiguration. On the other hand, there are situations whereby
these resources must be intentionally leaked. If the page were
unpinned and returned to the allocator, a subsequent wild DMA-write
to that physical address would corrupt memory belonging to the new
owner and could crash or compromise the host kernel.

vfio_ap_mdev_reset_queue()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AP_RESPONSE_Q_NOT_AVAIL (0x01) was not handled, causing it to fall
through to the default case which only fired a WARN without calling
vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources(). When ap_zapq() returns this response
code the queue is physically unavailable and can no longer generate
AP interrupts or DMA-write to the NIB. Add AP_RESPONSE_Q_NOT_AVAIL
alongside AP_RESPONSE_DECONFIGURED and AP_RESPONSE_CHECKSTOPPED so
that AQIC resources are freed immediately for all three
non-operational cases.

AP_RESPONSE_BUSY is not a valid response code for a PQAP(ZAPQ)
instruction, so it is removed. This contradicts what is stated in
the following:

commit 411b0109daa52 ("s390/vfio-ap: wait for response code 05 to clear on queue reset")

The latest verion of the AP architecture limits response codes for
PQAP_ZAPQ to response codes 01, 02, 03, 04 and 0x0A; 05 is not valid. So in
apq_status_check() - which examines the response codes returned
from PQAP-TAPQ - if the response code is AP_RESPONSE_BUSY (05) - which
is valid for PQAP-TAPQ - it will return -EAGAIN which instructs the caller
(apq_reset_check()) to re-issue the PQAP-ZAPQ instruction.

vfio_ap_mdev_remove_queue()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the AP bus scan detects a queue is no longer in the host AP
configuration, vfio_ap_mdev_remove_queue() skips the ZAPQ since
issuing it would return AP_RESPONSE_Q_NOT_AVAIL anyway. However,
vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources() was also never called, leaking the
pinned NIB page and registered guest ISC. Since the hardware is
gone and can no longer DMA-write to the NIB, it is safe to call
vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources() directly. Add an else branch to the
host-config test_bit_inv guard to free AQIC resources when the
queue is not in the host AP configuration. If the queue is not
assigned to an mdev, vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources() is a no-op.

apq_reset_check()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When apq_reset_check() returns from the -EIO path (TAPQ returned
an invalid response code), the TAPQ status is now copied to
q->reset_status. This ensures the queue is marked not-passable —
_queue_passable() checks for AP_RESPONSE_NORMAL — so the queue is
not passed through to a guest.

vfio_ap_irq_disable()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The valid response codes for PQAP(AQIC) include
AP_RESPONSE_STATE_CHANGE_IN_PROGRESS (0x0a),
AP_RESPONSE_INVALID_GISA (0x08),
AP_RESPONSE_ASSOC_SECRET_NOT_UNIQUE (0x35), and
AP_RESPONSE_ASSOC_FAILED (0x36), none of which were explicitly
handled. All four fell through to the default case which freed the
AQIC resources. These each should be handled differently:

* AP_RESPONSE_STATE_CHANGE_IN_PROGRESS indicates a transient
  condition, analogous to AP_RESPONSE_RESET_IN_PROGRESS and
  AP_RESPONSE_BUSY. It is added to the same case as
  RESET_IN_PROGRESS and RESPONSE_BUSY whereby the process sleeps
  for 20ms and the AQIC gets re-executed.

* AP_RESPONSE_INVALID_GISA indicates the AQIC instruction was
  rejected due to an invalid GISA address. The disable did not
  take effect and the hardware still holds the NIB page address.
  If the NIB page were unpinned and returned to the allocator, a
  subsequent wild DMA-write to that physical address would corrupt
  memory belonging to the new owner and could crash or compromise
  the host kernel; so the AQIC resources must be intentionally
  leaked.

* AP_RESPONSE_ASSOC_SECRET_NOT_UNIQUE and AP_RESPONSE_ASSOC_FAILED
  are asynchronous response codes from a previously executed
  association instruction. All subsequent AQIC calls will end with
  the asynchronous response code until the queue is reset;
  therefore the AQIC disable was not executed and the hardware
  still holds the NIB address. If the NIB page were unpinned and
  returned to the allocator, a subsequent wild DMA-write to that
  physical address would corrupt memory belonging to the new owner
  and could crash or compromise the host kernel; so the AQIC
  resources must be intentionally leaked.

After a return from vfio_ap_wait_for_irqclear(),
vfio_ap_irq_disable() frees the AQIC resources; however,
vfio_ap_wait_for_irqclear() can return for a number of reasons
which each require a different response:

* Timed out waiting for the IR bit to be cleared (indicates
  interrupts are disabled). In this case, the hardware still holds
  the NIB address. If the NIB page were unpinned and returned to
  the allocator, a subsequent wild DMA-write to that physical
  address would corrupt memory belonging to the new owner and
  could crash or compromise the host kernel; so the AQIC resources
  must be intentionally leaked.

* The response code from TAPQ indicates the queue is disabled,
  not in the host's AP configuration, or not functional. In any
  case, it is safe to free the AQIC resources.

* An invalid response code was returned from TAPQ. In this case,
  the hardware may still hold the NIB address; so the AQIC
  resources must be intentionally leaked.

The solution here is to change vfio_ap_wait_for_irqclear() to
return a code indicating the result, allowing vfio_ap_irq_disable()
to respond accordingly:
 * 0:         interrupt disablement is verified
 * -ENODEV:   the queue is not functional
 * -ETIMEDOUT: timed out without verifying interrupts disabled
 * -EIO:      an invalid response code was returned from TAPQ

vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The function used q->matrix_mdev->kvm and &q->matrix_mdev->vdev
when releasing the registered guest ISC and pinned NIB page
respectively. This is correct on the normal teardown path, but
becomes wrong when a queue reset times out and AQIC resources are
intentionally retained across a guest lifecycle. If the mdev is
subsequently opened by a new guest (new KVM, new IOMMU container),
a later call to vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources() — for example from
vfio_ap_irq_enable() when the new guest enables interrupts — would
release the old resources against the new guest's KVM and
vfio_device. This produces two bugs:

* kvm_s390_gisc_unregister(new_kvm, old_isc) drops a reference
  the new KVM never took. If the new guest uses the same ISC
  (Linux guests always use ISC 0), the refcount reaches zero and
  the alert mask bit is cleared while the queue is live, silently
  stopping AP interrupt delivery to the new guest.

* vfio_unpin_pages(new_vdev, old_iova) unpins from the wrong IOMMU
  container. The iommufd backend hits WARN_ON(!access); the type1
  backend hits WARN_ON(i != npage). The original pin in the old
  container is never dropped, causing vfio to warn about a
  non-empty pfn_list when that container is torn down.

Fix this by introducing struct vfio_ap_aqic_resources, which groups
the ISC, NIB IOVA, and the owning vfio_device and KVM together.
The struct replaces the standalone saved_isc and saved_iova fields
in struct vfio_ap_queue. vfio_ap_irq_enable() snapshots the owning
vdev and kvm at acquire time alongside the iova and isc.
vfio_ap_free_aqic_resources() then always releases each resource
against its original owner.

For the NIB page, aqic_resources.vdev (the vfio_device whose IOMMU
container holds the pin) is used unconditionally.

For the ISC, aqic_resources.kvm is compared against
q->matrix_mdev->kvm before calling kvm_s390_gisc_unregister(). If
they match, the same guest that registered the ISC is still running
and the unregister call proceeds normally. If they differ or the
current KVM is NULL, the original guest has already been shut down;
kvm_s390_gisa_destroy() will have zeroed the alert mask as part of
that guest's teardown, so calling unregister is unnecessary. A
warning is emitted to record that the ISC registration was not
explicitly released by this driver.

unmap_iova()
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calls vfio_ap_irq_disable() to disable interrupts for the queue,
but does not check the result. If the IRQ disable failed or could
not be confirmed, then vfio_ap_irq_disable() leaks the NIB to
prevent a wild DMA-write; however, the vfio core requires that the
NIB page be unpinned before dma_unmap returns, or it will BUG_ON
after 10 re-notification rounds.

The fix is to fall back to a bounded queue reset via ZAPQ, which
zeroizes the NIB pointer in the hardware, eliminating the DMA risk
that justified the leak. If the reset completes, the worker frees
the AQIC resources. If the reset times out or fails, the resources
are kept leaked to guard against wild DMA writes.
