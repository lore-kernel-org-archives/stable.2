The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm: page_alloc: make defrag_mode retries follow the promoted order
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-page_alloc-make-defrag_mode-retries-follow-the-promoted-order.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: mm: page_alloc: make defrag_mode retries follow the promoted order
Date: Tue, 13 Oct 2026 18:37:20 +0100

Since commit 7e8756d7ad22 ("mm: page_alloc: fix non-movable reclaim storm
in defrag_mode"), direct reclaim and compaction for non-movable requests
under defrag_mode run at pageblock_order, to produce the whole blocks that
ALLOC_NOFRAGMENT needs.  The retry decisions that follow still use the
request order.  An order-0 request can therefore retry indefinitely
without ever reaching the ALLOC_NOFRAGMENT fallback:

- Reclaim at pageblock_order gives up after one pass as soon as a zone
  looks compaction_ready(), and do_try_to_free_pages() then returns 1
  even though nothing was reclaimed. It returns before the retry that
  would reclaim memory.low-protected cgroups, so when most memory is
  protected, the pass that did run finds next to nothing.

- Compaction at pageblock_order fails or is deferred.

- should_reclaim_retry() takes the reported progress as progress for
  the order-0 request and resets no_progress_loops. The request
  retries.

Order 1-3 requests loop the same way, and should_compact_retry() also
checks their pageblock_order compaction result against the request order.

On a production host (64G, defrag_mode, memory.low covering most of the
workload), 95% of direct reclaim runs were order-9 runs that returned 1
with nothing reclaimed, at up to 60k runs per second.  Across ~200M
should_reclaim_retry() calls in a day, no_progress_loops never left 0. 
The spinning allocations were SLUB slab refills for inode and dentry
caches.  The time spent registers as memory pressure, and pressure-based
OOM killing takes down both workloads and system services.

For promoted requests:

- Reclaim progress does not reset no_progress_loops, as for costly
  orders.

- should_compact_retry() checks the compaction result at the promoted
  order and does not retry COMPACT_SKIPPED, since the request can fall
  back. The compaction priority floor and the COMPACT_SUCCESS retry
  limit stay those of the request order, so a non-costly request still
  gets its COMPACT_PRIO_SYNC_FULL pass before it falls back.

When a promoted request takes the fallback, reset the retry counters, so
that the fallback attempt gets a full retry budget before the OOM killer
is considered.  A request whose reclaim was not promoted spent its budget
on the request itself and keeps its counters, as Usama Arif pointed out.

__alloc_pages_slowpath() computes the promoted order once per iteration
and keeps it in alloc_context for direct reclaim, direct compaction and
the two retry helpers, so no callee has to recompute it.  Harry Yoo asked
for the promoted order to be explicit rather than derived in each callee,
and Vlastimil Babka suggested alloc_context over new function parameters.

In a VM reproducer (32G, defrag_mode, inode churn under memory.low):

                                        before    after
    should_reclaim_retry() calls           63M     293k
    peak memory pressure (PSI some avg10)  99%      12%

File creation runs 5.7x faster.
