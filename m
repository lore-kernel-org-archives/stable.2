This particular patch should be fine, but I have a question about
whether it's guaranteed that the diffs in these stable-review emails
will match the ones that actually get released.

As we know
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20261021164836.GB1879@quark/), the
cherry-pick process used by the stable maintainers doesn't actually use
'git cherry-pick' as expected, but rather formats the upstream patch as
a patch file with 3 lines of context, then applies it with a fuzz of 2.
That means only 1 line of context has to match for the patch to apply.

For this patch, those context lines are just a closing brace and an
empty line.  Those are very common!  So there are actually quite a few
other places in the file that the patch could have been applied to; it
seems the only thing that saves us in most cases is chance and the line
numbers not having shifted too much.

So my question is this: let's suppose the upstream commit did get
applied to the wrong place in the file that happened to share the same 1
line of context.  Of course, this email is being sent out with the
standard 3 lines of context.  Is this email the original patch file that
was applied (and thus the context doesn't necessarily match the context
in the commit that actually gets released), or is a new patch file
generated after application and that is what is sent out for review?
