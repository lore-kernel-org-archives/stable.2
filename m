I know that it's enabled in the defconfig and Qualcomm's BSP, so some
people have the module loaded on their systems.  That doesn't count as
use, let alone it being useful.

I'm not asking for a client name or any confidential information.  This
is a technical discussion, and I'm asking for proof that this driver can
actually provide a benefit for any specific Linux kernel feature over
the widely used and well-vetted alternatives (ICE and ARMv8 CE).

"We want this upstream for reasons that we refuse to disclose" is never
a reason for adding (or keeping) code in Linux.  There has to be a
technical justification.

Meanwhile, the strong technical arguments in favor of removal or marking
it BROKEN that have been presented remain unaddressed.
