Hey Jens,

So I took some time to figure it out, and I want to try out a slightly different process to address the concerns you've raised.

Instead of weekly AUTOSEL dumps, I'm just going to do them for a given release
after Linus tags it (so I'm going to do all of 7.2 in one go), about a week
after the release, and targetting just the LTS trees to reduce the number of
commits we backport.

This will make it easier for me to handle the volume of mails, and also reduce
the number of reviews folks do since we can skip the most recent stable (not
LTS) tree.

What are your thoughts on this change?

Sasha
