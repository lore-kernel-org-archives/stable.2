6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

Commit 8aa0e5db4845fb5ac11abe40d7b1cac0656c3ee3 upstream.

If the request to be cancelled is being run by io-wq,
io_async_cancel_one() flags the work, signals the worker and returns
-EALREADY. Since commit ccbf726171b7 ("io_uring: perform poll removal even
if async work removal is successful") io_try_cancel() goes on regardless,
as poll may be armed for the request. If it isn't, and nothing else turns
up, the result is the -ENOENT of the last search.

__io_async_cancel() makes up for that. On -ENOENT it tries the io-wq of
every task that uses the ring, and that of the caller is one of them. So
the work is found a second time, and the result is -EALREADY after all.

Unless the worker is done with it by then. If the work is flagged before
io_wq_submit_work() looks at IO_WQ_WORK_CANCEL, all the worker does is to
queue the request to be failed by task work. Then it isn't anywhere to be
found until the task work has run, and

 - IORING_REGISTER_SYNC_CANCEL returns -ENOENT,
 - IORING_OP_ASYNC_CANCEL completes with -ENOENT,

for a request that they have just cancelled, and that completes with
-ECANCELED.

With a read of an empty pipe, IOSQE_ASYNC, and a sync cancel right behind
it, 1 to 3 of 1,000,000 calls return -ENOENT, and 50 to 110 with
IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN (4 CPUs, KVM). Nothing is written to the pipe,
and all of these reads end with -ECANCELED.

Remember that the work was found. IORING_OP_ASYNC_CANCEL completes with
-EALREADY, as it does if the worker is a bit slower. For
IORING_REGISTER_SYNC_CANCEL it means to try again, which ends with 0.

The result of a linked timeout, which calls io_try_cancel() by itself,
and the number that is returned for IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_ALL and _ANY don't
change.
