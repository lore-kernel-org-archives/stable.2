6.6-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Gil Portnoy <dddhkts1@gmail.com>

commit 10f293a07f9e10e988b0ae44e2e99c631f5a68e0 upstream.

Commit f580d27e8928 ("ksmbd: fix use-after-free of a deferred file_lock on
double SMB2_CANCEL") made smb2_cancel() skip a work whose state is
KSMBD_WORK_CANCELLED, so its cancel_fn cannot be fired a second time. But
KSMBD_WORK has three states (ACTIVE, CANCELLED, CLOSED), and the same
freeing producer path is reached for CLOSED too:

  SMB2_CLOSE on the locking handle -> set_close_state_blocked_works() sets
  the deferred work's state to KSMBD_WORK_CLOSED and wakes the smb2_lock()
  worker. The worker takes the non-ACTIVE early-exit, locks_free_lock()s
  the file_lock and, because the state is not KSMBD_WORK_CANCELLED, takes
  the STATUS_RANGE_NOT_LOCKED branch with "goto out2" -- which, like the
  cancelled branch, skips release_async_work(). The work stays on
  conn->async_requests with a live cancel_fn = smb2_remove_blocked_lock
  pointing at the freed file_lock.

A subsequent SMB2_CANCEL for the same AsyncId then passes the
KSMBD_WORK_CANCELLED-only guard (its state is KSMBD_WORK_CLOSED), so
smb2_cancel() fires cancel_fn again over the freed file_lock -- the same
use-after-free fixed, via SMB2_CLOSE instead of a first SMB2_CANCEL:

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __locks_delete_block
    __locks_delete_block
    locks_delete_block
    ksmbd_vfs_posix_lock_unblock
    smb2_remove_blocked_lock
    smb2_cancel                 <- 2nd SMB2_CANCEL fires cancel_fn
    handle_ksmbd_work
  Allocated by ...: locks_alloc_lock <- smb2_lock
  Freed by ...:     locks_free_lock  <- smb2_lock (non-ACTIVE early-exit)
  ... cache file_lock_cache of size 192

Reproduced on mainline 7.1-rc7 (which already contains f580d27e8928) with
KASAN by an authenticated SMB client; the double-SMB2_CANCEL control is
silent on that kernel, so the splat is attributable to the CLOSE trigger.

Only an ACTIVE deferred work may have its cancel_fn fired: both terminal
states (CANCELLED and CLOSED) reach the smb2_lock() early-exit that frees
the file_lock and skips release_async_work(). Guard on KSMBD_WORK_ACTIVE
so any non-active work is skipped.
