No, we currently don't ship TZ firmware that could cause such interactions.
The only driver that currently suffers from such races is the NAND driver
which races with the modem firmware and it too will use the BAM locking
feature once it's upstream. However we do plan to support DRM using this IP
and this is when it'll need to account for possible races. IOW: BAM locking
is not strictly required to fix the QCE.

We can offload crypto operations to the QCE saving CPU cycles but more
importantly, the QCE provides HW based isolation which some vendors care
about.

That may have been true when you sent the v1 but with a set of proposed fixes
it'll no longer be the case.

These are future plans, yes. But right now we do have active users of this
IP and now also a maintainer - yours truly - who stepped up and is actively
working on this module. With the fixes applied, the driver will again pass
crypto self-tests and should not be BROKEN.

Thanks,
