[ Upstream commit 5cae719943399929b4f9e612d9400017d3e2c1e1 ]

coresight_enable_path() enables helpers attached to every device in
the path, including those bound to the source. However,
coresight_disable_path() skips the source node, so source helpers had
to be disabled separately in coresight_disable_source().

Move source helper disabling into coresight_disable_path() instead.
Make coresight_disable_path_from() start from the passed node nd, so
it can also disable helpers on the source. Update the comments
accordingly.

As coresight_disable_path_from() now changes its semantics from
"start beyond nd" to "start from nd", update the failure handling in
coresight_enable_path(). If enabling a node fails, iterate to the
previous node (the last successfully enabled one) and pass it to
coresight_disable_path_from() for rollback.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

### Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE
**Record:** `[coresight] [Disable] [source helpers in
coresight_disable_path()]`

Subsystem: CoreSight (ARM hardware tracing). Action: disable/fix
asymmetry in path teardown.

### Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS
**Record:**
- **Fixes:** — absent (expected for manual review)
- **Reported-by:** — none
- **Tested-by:** Jie Gan `<jie.gan@oss.qualcomm.com>`, James Clark
  `<james.clark@linaro.org>`
- **Reviewed-by:** Yeoreum Yun `<yeoreum.yun@arm.com>`, James Clark
  `<james.clark@linaro.org>`
- **Link:** `https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260515-
  arm_coresight_path_power_management_improvement-v14-15-
  f88c4a3ecfe9@arm.com`
- **Cc: stable:** — none
- **Signed-off-by:** Leo Yan, Suzuki K Poulose (ignore pipeline SOB)

Notable: two subsystem reviewers and two testers; no syzbot/user crash
report.

### Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT
**Record:**
- **Bug:** `coresight_enable_path()` enables helpers on every path node
  (including the source), but `coresight_disable_path()` skipped the
  source node, so source-attached helpers were only torn down via a
  separate call in `coresight_disable_source()`.
- **Symptom:** Error rollback paths that call only
  `coresight_disable_path()` leave source helpers enabled
  (hardware/resource leak, inconsistent tracing state).
- **Root cause:** `coresight_disable_path_from()` used
  `list_for_each_entry_continue()` starting after the source node;
  enable/disable were asymmetric.
- **Fix:** Move source-helper teardown into `coresight_disable_path()`,
  change `coresight_disable_path_from()` to start *from* `nd`
  (`list_for_each_entry_from()`), and fix `coresight_enable_path()`
  rollback to pass the last successfully enabled node.
- **Version info:** Patch 15/28 of v14 CoreSight path power-management
  series (May 2026).

### Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES
**Record:** Not disguised cleanup — explicit bug fix for enable/disable
imbalance. The existing in-tree comment at lines 380–388 already
documents this as a known problem.

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

### Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES
**Record:**
- **Files:** `drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-core.c` only (+8 /
  −19 lines)
- **Functions modified:** `coresight_disable_source()`,
  `coresight_disable_path_from()`, `coresight_disable_path()` (wrapper
  unchanged), `coresight_enable_path()`
- **Scope:** Single-file, surgical fix

### Step 2.2: CODE FLOW CHANGE (per hunk)
**Record:**
1. **`coresight_disable_source()`:** Before: disable source ops +
   `coresight_disable_helpers()`. After: disable source ops only;
   helpers owned by path disable.
2. **`coresight_disable_path_from()`:** Before:
   `list_for_each_entry_continue()` skipped the starting node (source
   when `nd==NULL`). After: `list_for_each_entry_from()` includes
   starting node; source case still skips source ops but runs
   `coresight_disable_helpers()` on source.
3. **`coresight_enable_path()` rollback:** Before: passed failing node
   `nd` to `disable_path_from()` with “beyond nd” semantics. After:
   advances to `list_next_entry(nd)` (last successfully enabled node)
   before rollback, matching new “from nd” semantics.

### Step 2.3: BUG MECHANISM
**Record:** **Category:** Error-path resource / hardware-state leak
(reference-counting / lifecycle asymmetry). **Mechanism:**
`coresight_enable_path()` calls `coresight_enable_helpers()` on all
nodes including source; `coresight_disable_path()` never visited the
source node, so source helpers stayed enabled unless
`coresight_disable_source()` was also called.

### Step 2.4: FIX QUALITY
**Record:** Fix is minimal and logically correct. In-tree callers of
`coresight_disable_source()` (`coresight-sysfs.c:98`, `coresight-etm-
perf.c:685`) are always followed by `coresight_disable_path()`, so
removing helper teardown from `disable_source()` is safe for in-tree
code. Low regression risk; `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL` means out-of-tree callers
that only call `disable_source()` would need updating (none found in-
tree).

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

### Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES
**Record:** Shallow tree (50 commits); `git blame` attributes current
`coresight_disable_source()` body to `a112b91dd6349`. Helper
infrastructure (`coresight_is_helper`, `coresight_enable_helpers`,
CATU/CTI/CTCU helpers) is present in this 6.18.43 tree. Related helper
introduction referenced in series as `6148652807ba` (“Enable and disable
helper devices adjacent to the path”) — not individually verifiable in
this shallow history, but helper code is present.

### Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG
**Record:** No `Fixes:` tag on this commit. N/A.

### Step 3.3: FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES
**Record:** Part of v14 28-patch series (`v14_20260515_leo_yan_coresight
_refactor_power_management_for_coresight_path.mbx`). Patch 15 is
standalone in `coresight-core.c`; patch 16 (“Control path with range”)
builds on it but is not a prerequisite. Related sibling fixes: patch 1
(idr_alloc failure), patch 2 (helper enable unwind).

### Step 3.4: AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS
**Record:** Leo Yan authored the CoreSight path PM series; Reviewed-by
includes Arm/Linaro maintainers. Strong subsystem review signal.

### Step 3.5: DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS
**Record:** No hard dependency on later series patches. Applies to
current tree structure (`coresight_enable_path()` with `sink_data`
parameter). Standalone.

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

### Step 4.1: ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION
**Record:** Lore fetch blocked (Anubis bot protection). Used local mbox:
`v14_20260515_leo_yan_coresight_refactor_power_management_for_coresight_
path.mbx`. Patch 15/28 confirmed at lines 2131–2234. Series cover letter
describes patches 14–23 as path enable/disable refactor. No stable
nomination found in mbox grep.

### Step 4.2: WHO REVIEWED
**Record:** `b4 dig -c HEAD` failed (commit not in tree). From commit
message: Yeoreum Yun (Arm), James Clark (Linaro) reviewed; Jie Gan
(Qualcomm) and James Clark tested.

### Step 4.3: BUG REPORT
**Record:** No external bug report or syzbot link. Bug inferred from
code asymmetry and documented in existing kernel comment.

### Step 4.4: RELATED PATCHES / SERIES
**Record:** 28-patch series; this is patch 15. Patches 1–2 fix related
teardown bugs. Patch 15 does not require the CPU-PM refactor patches
(11–28) for correctness in the current tree.

### Step 4.5: STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY
**Record:** No `Cc: stable` or stable-list discussion found in local
mbox.

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

### Step 5.1: KEY FUNCTIONS
**Record:** `coresight_disable_source()`,
`coresight_disable_path_from()`, `coresight_disable_path()`,
`coresight_enable_path()`, `coresight_disable_helpers()`

### Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS
**Record:**
- `coresight_enable_path()` ← `coresight_enable_sysfs()` (`coresight-
  sysfs.c:218`), `etm_event_start()` (`coresight-etm-perf.c:531`)
- `coresight_disable_path()` ← `coresight_enable_sysfs()` error path
  (`:262`), `coresight_disable_sysfs()` (`:308`), `etm_event_start()`
  failure (`:563`), `etm_event_stop()` (`:724`)

**Buggy callers (disable_path without prior disable_source):**
- `coresight-sysfs.c:262` — `enable_path` succeeded,
  `enable_source_sysfs` failed
- `coresight-etm-perf.c:563` — `enable_path` succeeded,
  `source_ops->enable` failed

### Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES
**Record:** `coresight_disable_helpers()` → `coresight_disable_helper()`
→ `helper_ops()->disable()`; affects CATU, CTI, CTCU helper devices
attached to sources.

### Step 5.4: CALL CHAIN / REACHABILITY
**Record:** Reachable from sysfs writes (`enable_source_store`) and perf
events (`perf record` with CoreSight/ETM). Requires `CONFIG_CORESIGHT`
and ARM CoreSight hardware. Admin/capability-gated, not arbitrary
unprivileged userspace — but real on Qualcomm/Arm platforms.

### Step 5.5: SIMILAR PATTERNS
**Record:** Existing comment explicitly documents the enable/disable
imbalance; patch 2 in same series fixes partial helper enable unwind in
`coresight_enable_helpers()`.

---

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST LOCAL TREE

### Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST?
**Record:** **YES.** Local tree is **6.18.43** (`git describe`:
`v6.18.43-1-gc7f0dac02d232`). Current code at `coresight-core.c:433`
uses `list_for_each_entry_continue`; `coresight_disable_source()` at
`:393` still calls `coresight_disable_helpers(csdev, NULL)`. Imbalance
comment present at `:384–388`.

### Step 6.2: BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS
**Record:** **Clean apply expected.** Patch hunks match current file
structure (verified `err_disable_path` at lines 561–565). Only
`coresight-core.c` touched.

### Step 6.3: RELATED FIXES ALREADY PRESENT?
**Record:** Commit not in tree. Patch 1 (idr_alloc) and patch 2 (helper
enable unwind) also not present — separate issues; patch 15 is
independently valuable.

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

### Step 7.1: SUBSYSTEM CRITICALITY
**Record:** **PERIPHERAL** — `drivers/hwtracing/coresight/`, ARM
debug/trace infrastructure. Important for Arm/Android/embedded
developers, not universal.

### Step 7.2: SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY
**Record:** Actively developed; large v14 refactor series in flight.
Helper support (CATU, CTI, CTCU) present in this tree.

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

### Step 8.1: WHO IS AFFECTED
**Record:** Users of CoreSight tracing on Arm SoCs (sysfs manual trace,
perf aux trace). Config-specific: `CONFIG_CORESIGHT`.

### Step 8.2: TRIGGER CONDITIONS
**Record:** Error paths during trace session setup — source enable fails
after path (and source helpers) were enabled. Uncommon but realistic
during misconfiguration or transient hardware errors. Not every boot;
not unprivileged.

### Step 8.3: FAILURE MODE SEVERITY
**Record:** Source helper devices (e.g., CATU) left enabled →
**resource/hardware state leak**, subsequent tracing sessions may fail
until reboot. **Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH** for affected subsystem (not
kernel panic, not data corruption, but functional breakage of tracing
and leaked hardware state).

### Step 8.4: RISK-BENEFIT
**Record:**
- **Benefit:** Fixes real teardown bug on error paths; aligns
  enable/disable symmetry; improves `enable_path()` rollback
  correctness.
- **Risk:** Very low — 27-line single-file change, reviewed by subsystem
  maintainers, in-tree callers verified safe.
- **Ratio:** Moderate benefit for Arm tracing users, very low risk →
  favorable.

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

### Step 9.1: EVIDENCE COMPILED

**FOR backport:**
- Real, documented bug (in-tree comment acknowledges imbalance)
- Leaves helper hardware enabled on error paths
- Small, surgical, single-file fix
- Reviewed by Arm/Linaro maintainers; tested on Qualcomm/Arm hardware
- Buggy code confirmed present in 6.18.43
- Clean apply expected
- Fixes `enable_path()` rollback semantics bug

**AGAINST backport:**
- Part of larger 28-patch refactor (but patch 15 is standalone)
- Error-path only, not normal teardown
- Peripheral subsystem, config-gated
- No syzbot/crash report
- No explicit stable nomination
- Medium severity, not crash/security/corruption

**Unresolved:** Full lore thread inaccessible; cannot verify maintainer
stable discussion.

### Step 9.2: STABLE RULES CHECKLIST
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — logic clear; multiple
   Tested-by/Reviewed-by
2. Fixes a real bug affecting users? **PASS** — error-path helper leak
   on Arm CoreSight
3. Important issue? **PASS (borderline)** — hardware state leak /
   tracing breakage, not crash/corruption
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — one file, ~27 lines
5. No new features/APIs? **PASS** — lifecycle bug fix only
6. Can apply to local tree? **PASS** — code present, patch matches

### Step 9.3: EXCEPTION CATEGORIES
**Record:** None (not device ID, quirk, DT, build, or docs fix).

### Step 9.4: DECISION RATIONALE

This commit fixes a genuine enable/disable asymmetry in CoreSight path
management. On error rollback paths in `coresight_enable_sysfs()` and
`etm_event_start()` that call only `coresight_disable_path()`, source-
attached helper devices remain enabled because the disable path skipped
the source node. That can leave tracing hardware in a bad state and
break subsequent sessions. The fix is small, reviewed, applies cleanly
to 6.18.43, and does not depend on the rest of the v14 refactor series.
