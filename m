6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Bernard Pidoux <bernard.f6bvp@gmail.com>

A Restart Request is the X.25 way to say that every virtual circuit of
a link is gone. rose_link_rx_restart() only marks the neighbour as
restarted and answers with a Restart Confirmation: the sockets and the
through routes that used the link are left as they were.

That is harmless on a link coming up, nothing is established yet. It
is not when the other end restarts its AX.25 and ROSE stack while we
keep the link: the first thing it sends is a SABM, which resets our
AX.25 connection without bringing it down, then a Restart Request. Its
circuits are gone, ours stay in state 3 forever:

 - a frame for a logical channel that the other end does not know is
   dropped silently by rose_route_frame(), so no Clear Request ever
   comes back;
 - no timer watches the acknowledgement of data in state 3, and the
   idle timer is off by default;
 - the through routes stay in /proc/net/rose_routes and the remote
   ends of those calls are never told.

The stale entries are not just a leak. The restarted end allocates its
logical channel numbers afresh, so a new circuit can get the number of
a stale through route on the same link, and whatever still arrives on
the stale half is then relayed into the new circuit.

Seen on a live network: a node that restarts its stack from cron left,
on each of three neighbours, a data circuit with five unacknowledged
frames that never moved again, and five through routes on the node
that relays for the others.

Clear them when a Restart Request arrives on a link that is already
up: send a Clear Request to the other half of each through route and
drop the route, and disconnect the local sockets, as rose_link_failed()
does when the link goes down. The loop of rose_del_route_by_neigh() is
moved to a helper for that, since the caller here already holds
rose_route_list_lock. Nothing is sent to the restarting neighbour: it
has no circuit left, and a Clear Request could hit a call it has just
placed on a reused channel number.

A link that is not up yet is left alone: nothing can be established
over it, and the sockets found there are calls waiting in neigh->queue
for the restart to complete.

Tested with three QEMU guests in a line, A - B - C, on a kernel with
lockdep and KASAN. A calls C through B and B calls C, both circuits
stay open, then C destroys and recreates its AX.25 interface, reloads
its routes and calls B. Before: both circuits are still open a minute
later, B keeps the through route, nobody is told. After: A and B get
the circuit cleared (cause 0x09) within a second of the Restart
Request, B has no through route left, and the new call from C goes
through at the first attempt. Four runs, no lockdep, KASAN or refcount
report.
