6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

Gregg reports that the iomap retry behavior for nonblocking (nowait)
append writes is broken. The problem occurs when an append write is
first submitted in non-blocking mode (i.e. via io_uring), partially
completes before hitting -EAGAIN, and then is resubmitted from
blocking context.

The specific problem is that at least one iteration of the loop in
iomap_write_iter() completes in non-blocking context and thus has
bumped i_size. The next iteration hits -EAGAIN, reverts the iov_iter
and returns. io_uring retries the entire append write from blocking
context, but since i_size has already been increased, the data that
was partially written on the first attempt is rewritten at the new
i_size. This is essentially an intra-write data corruption since the
data written to the file does not reflect the write from userspace.

This problem is already fixed on master as of commit 1a1a3b574b97
("iomap: advance the iter directly on buffered writes"). That commit
was primarily intended to clean up iomap iter state tracking, but it
also happened to remove the iov_iter revert and thus accidentally
fix this problem as well. Without the revert, iomap will commit
partial progress internally and loop once more before it more than
likely hits -EAGAIN and returns partial progress consistent with the
inode updates. This means the blocking retry from io_uring will pick
up where the first attempt left off at the current i_size and
perform the remainder of the write correctly.
