Subject: [PATCH] dm log writes: log flush batches in the order the flushes were issued
Date: Mon, 19 Oct 2026 17:43:39 +0300

dm-log-writes gives a flush the writes that completed before the flush
was issued, and logs that batch when the flush completes.  When two
flushes are in flight at once and the later one completes first, its
batch is logged first.  If both batches hold a write to the same
sector, the log then has the older write after the newer one:

	W1,C1,Wflush1,W1',C1',Wflush2,Cflush2,Cflush1

is logged as

	W1',flush2,W1,flush1

and a replay ends with W1, although the device held W1' from the
moment flush2 completed.

Two flushes can be in flight at once on a device with more than one
hardware queue, because each queue runs its own flush sequence.  Two
tasks that fsync at the same time can hit this.  We hit it recording
ext4 on an 8-queue virtio-blk disk: the older version of a file's data
block was in the batch of a jbd2 commit's flush, the newer version in
the batch of an empty flush issued after it, and the commit's flush
completed last.  The replayed file held a stale block that the device
never held after the empty flush completed.  On the same disk, fstests
generic/455 on xfs (four fsx processes that fsync concurrently) failed
with "md5sum mismatched" in 5 of 31 runs without this change and in 0
of 31 runs with it.

When a flush completes, every write that completed before the flush
was issued is durable.  That includes the writes held by earlier
flushes that have not completed yet.  Keep the flushes in flight in
issue order.  When a flush completes, log the batches of the earlier
flushes first, then its own.  An earlier flush still logs its own
entry when it completes; by then its batch is empty.

An AI coding assistant found the problem while investigating a false
failure in a crash-consistency test harness.  It also wrote the
reproducer and the first version of this change.

Based on linux-dm for-next (dm-7.4, 334714e4bdf8).  Both files are
identical on dm-7.3 (fc79aeb86a2c) and mainline (c03c1a14507d), so the
patch applies there unchanged.

Tested in an 8-vCPU QEMU/KVM guest (Ubuntu 24.04 userspace) booted on
this tree, built from defconfig + kvm_guest.config with
DM_LOG_WRITES=y.  The virtio-blk disks have 8 hardware queues and a
write-back cache.  Stock vs patched:

- Reproducer (script below): the data device is an in-process nbd
  server with two connections, so its queue has two hardware queues.
  The server holds the first flush until a second flush, issued from a
  CPU on the other queue, has completed.  On one block: write OLD,
  fsync (held), write NEW, fsync (completes), release the first flush.
  Stock: the log reads NEW,flush,OLD,flush and replays to OLD, 20 of
  20 runs.  Patched: OLD,NEW,flush,flush and NEW, 20 of 20.

- Stress, no injected delays: 8 threads, one per CPU, each rewriting
  its own blocks with O_DIRECT write + fsync through log-writes on a
  virtio-blk disk, 20 s per run, 8 runs.  Stock: an older version of a
  block logged after a newer one in 5 of 8 runs (7 entries, 231k
  write+fsync pairs).  Patched: 0 of 8 runs (203k pairs).

- fstests generic/455, generic/457 and generic/482 pass with the patch
  on ext4, xfs and btrfs.  Without it, generic/455 on xfs fails with
  "testfileN.markM md5sum mismatched" in 5 of 31 iterations; with it,
  0 of 31.  On ext4 it passed 11 of 11 both ways.

- No kernel warnings in any run.  The WARN_ON added to the destructor
  never fired over several hundred device teardowns.

- drivers/md/dm-log-writes.o built with W=1 and with C=1 (sparse
  0.6.4): no warnings before or after.  checkpatch.pl --strict: clean.

Not done: generic/470 (needs a DAX device; "not run" here); no run on
real multi-queue hardware (only virtio-blk and nbd); no explicit
single-queue test beyond what fstests used.  The same code change,
built out of tree against Ubuntu's 6.8 kernel, gave the same
reproducer and stress results there.

Performance: fio through log-writes on the same guest, 8 jobs, 4k
random writes, O_DIRECT, psync, 5 rounds alternating between the two
kernels.  With fsync after every write, so up to 8 flushes in flight:
1235 vs 1218 IOPS, fsync latency 4.5 vs 4.6 ms mean and 13.0 ms p99 on
both.  With fsync every 64 writes: 18853 vs 18933 IOPS.  The spread
between rounds for one kernel is 4-12%, so no measurable difference.
None is expected: the patch adds one list insertion per flush at map
time and, when a flush completes, a loop over the flushes in flight,
which are at most as many as the hardware queues.

Memory: struct pending_block grows by one list_head, from 64 to 80
bytes on x86_64, next to the 4 KiB page copy it holds per segment.

An alternative design would keep every completed write in
unflushed_blocks, stamp it with the number of flushes issued so far,
and let a completing flush move the writes whose stamp is below its
own number.  That models the rule more directly and a failed flush
needs no special handling, but it replaces the batch mechanism rather
than correcting it and walks the batch on completion instead of
splicing it.  This patch keeps the existing design; switching is easy
if you prefer the other.

The stress script is available on request.

Reproducer.  Python 3, run as root in a VM; LOGDEV is overwritten.
Needs nbd and dm-log-writes, built in or as modules.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
dm-log-writes: two flushes that overlap and complete out of order put an
older write after a newer write of the same sector in the log.

Stack:
    /dev/mapper/lwrepro = log-writes /dev/nbd0 LOGDEV

/dev/nbd0 is served by this script over two connections, so the nbd queue
has two hardware queues and two flushes can be in flight at once.  The
server holds the first flush until the second one has completed, which
makes the interleaving deterministic.

Sequence, all on block 0 of the data device:

    1. write "OLD"   O_DIRECT, completes           -> unflushed = [OLD]
    2. fsync #1      flush F1 issued, server holds  -> F1 takes [OLD]
    3. write "NEW"   O_DIRECT, completes           -> unflushed = [NEW]
    4. fsync #2      flush F2 issued, completes     -> F2 takes [NEW]
                     fsync #2 returns
    5. server releases F1, fsync #1 returns
    6. fsync #3      flush F3, nothing pending

The device received OLD before NEW, and both writes completed before a
flush that then completed, so the device holds NEW.  Replaying the log must
give NEW too.  dm-log-writes logs a flush's batch when that flush
completes, so it logs [NEW] at step 4 and [OLD] at step 5, and the replay
ends with OLD: a state the device never held.

Usage (as root, in a VM; LOGDEV is overwritten):
    dmlw-flush-reorder.py LOGDEV [ITERATIONS]
Exit status: 0 if the log replays to what the device holds, 1 if not.

 cases where a power failure at a particular point in time would create an
 inconsistent file system.
 
+Two REQ_PREFLUSH requests can be in flight at the same time and complete in the
+opposite order.  The flush that completes first makes the WRITEs held by the
+earlier flush durable too, since they completed before either flush was issued,
+so those are logged first, followed by its own.  Consider the following example,
+where W1 and W1' both write the same sector:
+
+	W1,C1,Wflush1,W1',C1',Wflush2,Cflush2,Cflush1
+
+The log would show the following:
+
+	W1,W1',flush2,flush1
+
+Logging each flush's WRITEs when that flush completes would log W1 after W1',
+and a replay would end with W1, which the device never held after flush2.
+
 Any REQ_FUA requests bypass this flushing mechanism and are logged as soon as
 they complete as those requests will obviously bypass the device cache.
