From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

[ Upstream commit b7befd6d91207cf3f4cecd68fea0c212093906cf ]

timekeeping_apply_adjustment() modifies xtime_nsec to ensure monotonicity
when mult changes:

    xtime_nsec -= offset

This ensures that the time reported to userspace does not jump when the
multiplier is adjusted from one tick to the next. However, the ntp_error
accumulator which tracks the difference between intended and actual
clock position was not being updated to reflect this additional
discrepancy.

An earlier attempt at this compensation existed as:

    ntp_error -= (interval - offset) << ntp_error_shift

but was removed in commit c2cda2a5bda9 ("timekeeping/ntp: Don't align
NTP frequency adjustments to ticks") because it was a major source of
NTP error. That's because (interval - offset) was wrong: the subtraction
of "interval" prematurely accounted for the changed xtime_interval of
the next tick, which would be correctly accounted in the next
accumulation anyway — a double subtraction.

What is actually needed is just the "offset" part: ntp_error must be
told that xtime_nsec moved by "offset" without a corresponding change
in the intended position. For the normal ±1 mult dithering this is
negligible (the adjustments cancel over time), but for larger mult
changes — such as when an external reference clock sets a new
frequency — the one-time uncompensated offset is significant.

Fix by adjusting ntp_error by the correct amount:

    ntp_error += offset << ntp_error_shift

This keeps ntp_error consistent with the actual xtime_nsec position
after the adjustment, and ensures the discrepancy is correctly smoothed
away over time and the clock returns to where it should have been.
