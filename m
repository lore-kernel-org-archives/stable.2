[ Upstream commit eaf478b3ea68e1b5df659acd24c4df5850e12325 ]

On a split phy qcn9274 (2.4GHz + 5GHz low), "iw phy" reports 320MHz
related features on the 5GHz band while it should not:

    Wiphy phy1
    [...]
        Band 2:
    [...]
            EHT Iftypes: managed
    [...]
                EHT PHY Capabilities: (0xe2ffdbe018778000):
                    320MHz in 6GHz Supported
    [...]
                    Beamformee SS (320MHz): 7
    [...]
                    Number Of Sounding Dimensions (320MHz): 3
    [...]
                EHT MCS/NSS: (0x22222222222222222200000000):

This is also reflected in the beacons sent by a mesh interface started on
that band. They erroneously advertise 320MHz support too.

This should not happen as IEEE Std 802.11-2024, subclause 9.4.2.323.3 says
we should not set the 320MHz related fields when not operating on a 6GHz
band. For example it says about Bit 0 "Support For 320 MHz In 6 GHz"

  "Reserved if the EHT Capabilities element is indicating capabilities for
   the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands."

Fix this by clearing the related bits when converting from WMI eht phy
capabilities to mac80211 phy capabilities, for bands other than 6GHz.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

This is a 6.18.y tree (`v6.18.53`). The patch is a small ath12k
firmware-workaround that stops 5 GHz/2.4 GHz from advertising 6 GHz-only
320 MHz EHT bits, including in mesh beacons.

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE**
- Record: `[ath12k / wifi] [avoid] [do not advertise 320 MHz EHT
  capabilities on non-6 GHz bands]`

**Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS**
- Record:
  - No `Fixes:` tag (expected for this review; Qualcomm review of v2
    asked for one because the bug is user-visible, and v3 still omitted
    it)
  - No `Reported-by:`, `Tested-by:`, `Cc: stable`
  - `Reviewed-by: Baochen Qiang <baochen.qiang@oss.qualcomm.com>`
  - `Reviewed-by: Rameshkumar Sundaram
    <rameshkumar.sundaram@oss.qualcomm.com>`
  - `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260623151613.72113-1-
    nico.escande@gmail.com`
  - `Signed-off-by: Nicolas Escande` (author)
  - `Signed-off-by: Jeff Johnson` (ath maintainer; applied to ath-next)
  - `Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI ...` (hardware test, not a tag)
  - Ignore `[Upstream commit eaf478b3ea68...]` and `Signed-off-by: Sasha
    Levin` (pipeline)

**Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT**
- Record: On split-phy QCN9274 (2.4 GHz + 5 GHz low), firmware-reported
  EHT PHY caps are copied onto the 5 GHz band, so `iw phy` shows “320MHz
  in 6GHz Supported”, beamformee SS 320 MHz, and 320 MHz sounding
  dimensions. Mesh beacons on that band advertise the same. IEEE
  802.11-2024 9.4.2.323.3 marks those fields reserved off 6 GHz.
- Symptom: wrong userspace capability dump and wrong over-the-air EHT
  Capabilities IE.
- Root cause: WMI EHT PHY caps are copied as-is; 320 MHz/6 GHz bits are
  not cleared for 2.4/5 GHz.
- Version info: none beyond QCN9274 test hardware.

**Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES**
- Record: Not a disguised cleanup. It is an explicit correctness/spec
  fix (firmware workaround). “Avoid setting” here means “stop
  advertising reserved bits.”

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES**
- Record: Single file `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k/wmi.c`, +16/−1.
  Function: `ath12k_wmi_eht_caps_parse()`. Surgical, one-driver.

**Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE**
- Before: after `le32_to_cpu()` of firmware PHY caps, only the 6 GHz
  path ORs back a saved 320 MHz bit. 2.4/5 GHz keep whatever firmware
  sent, including 320 MHz/6 GHz bits.
- After: 6 GHz path unchanged; non-6 GHz path clears eight reserved 320
  MHz/6 GHz fields in the byte view of `eht_cap_phy_info[]`.
- Path: capability parse at firmware ready / MAC-PHY caps-ext, not a hot
  datapath.

**Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM**
- Record: Category (h) firmware workaround + (g) protocol correctness.
- Mechanism: firmware reports 6 GHz/320 MHz caps on the 5 GHz WMI blob.
  Those bits are memcpy’d into mac80211 `ieee80211_sta_eht_cap`
  (`ath12k_mac_copy_eht_cap()`). `ieee80211_eht_mcs_nss_size()` adds 3
  MCS/NSS bytes when `IEEE80211_EHT_PHY_CAP0_320MHZ_IN_6GHZ` is set, so
  5 GHz beacons can carry a longer EHT Capabilities IE than a spec-
  compliant peer expects. cfg80211 still refuses 320 MHz off 6 GHz
  (`net/wireless/chan.c`), so the kernel will not actually operate at
  320 MHz on 5 GHz.

**Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY**
- Record: Obviously correct. Masks match
  `include/linux/ieee80211-eht.h`. `WMI_MAX_EHTCAP_PHY_SIZE` is 3 u32s
  (12 bytes); `phy_cap[7]` is in range. u8 overlay of a host-endian u32
  array matches existing ath12k memcpy of the same array into
  `phy_cap_info[]` (little-endian hosts, which is where QCN9274 runs).
  No API/lock/alloc change. Regression risk is low: only reserved bits
  on non-6 GHz are cleared. Review expanded v1’s incomplete mask set; v3
  clears the full set Qualcomm asked for.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES**
- Record: Function added in `1476014fadb662` (“wifi: ath12k: WMI support
  to process EHT capabilities”), contained in `v6.6-rc1`. 320 MHz
  preserve/OR logic added in `d4e244c85e45df` (“enable 320 MHz bandwidth
  for 6 GHz… WCN7850”), in v6.7. Buggy “copy firmware bits onto 5 GHz
  unchanged” behavior is as old as EHT parse in this driver (~v6.6).
  Present throughout 6.18.

**Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG**
- Record: No `Fixes:` tag. Closest introducing commits are
  `1476014fadb662` and `d4e244c85e45df`; both are ancestors of `v6.18`.
  No later follow-up on this file after the upstream commit.

**Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY**
- Record: Nearby `wmi.c` work is unrelated (endianness, TLV length,
  scan). Standalone; not patch X/Y.

**Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS**
- Record: Nicolas Escande is a regular ath11k/ath12k contributor
  (Freebox/Iliad), not the subsystem maintainer. Jeff Johnson applied
  it. Qualcomm (Baochen Qiang, Rameshkumar Sundaram) reviewed.

**Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS**
- Record: None. Uses existing `NL80211_BAND_*` and
  `IEEE80211_EHT_PHY_CAP*` symbols already in this tree. Applies
  standalone.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION**
- Record: `b4 dig -c eaf478b3ea68` →
  https://patch.msgid.link/20260623151613.72113-1-nico.escande@gmail.com
- Series: v1 (2026-01-23) → v2 (2026-06-11) → v3 (2026-06-23, applied).
  v1 incomplete masks; v2/v3 clear remaining 320 MHz/6 GHz fields after
  Qualcomm/Pablo feedback. v3 vs v2 is comment/typo/spec-citation
  cleanup.
- No NAKs. Jeff Johnson: “Applied, thanks!”
- No reviewer `Cc: stable` on v3.

**Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH**
- Record (`b4 dig -w`): To/Cc `ath12k@lists.infradead.org`, `linux-
  wireless@vger.kernel.org`. Reviewers: Rameshkumar Sundaram, Baochen
  Qiang (Qualcomm). Johannes Berg (mac80211) on v1: this is a firmware
  workaround and belongs in the driver, not mac80211. Pablo MARTIN-GOMEZ
  (Freebox) pointed out missing CAP7 bits.

**Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT**
- Record: No syzbot/bugzilla. Author reproduced on QCN9274 split-phy;
  `iw phy` dump and mesh beacons in the message. Real hardware, not
  theoretical.

**Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES**
- Record: Single-patch series. v1→v3 only refined which reserved bits to
  clear. No hidden dependency.

**Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY**
- Record: No useful stable-list discussion of this subject. WebSearch of
  lore stable did not turn up this patch. UNVERIFIED beyond that (lore
  HTTP 403 on direct fetch; thread recovered via `b4`).

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: KEY FUNCTIONS**
- Record: `ath12k_wmi_eht_caps_parse()` only.

**Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS**
- Record: Only from `ath12k_wmi_tlv_mac_phy_caps_ext_parse()` for 2.4 /
  5 / 6 GHz. That is called from `ath12k_wmi_tlv_mac_phy_caps_ext()`,
  registered as the WMI TLV parser for
  `WMI_TAG_MAC_PHY_CAPABILITIES_EXT` during service-ready. Device bring-
  up, not IRQ/hot path.

**Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES**
- Record: `le32_to_cpu()` and bit clears only. No alloc/lock/IO.

**Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN**
- Record: firmware ready → WMI caps-ext → `ath12k_mac_copy_eht_cap()` →
  mac80211 sband iftype data → `iw phy`, association, and beacon IEs.
  Reachable for any ath12k user with 11be firmware (QCN9274, WCN7850,
  etc.). Unprivileged users cannot trigger a crash; they do
  see/advertise wrong caps. Mesh/AP beacons go over the air.

**Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS**
- Record: rtw89 and mt76 only *set* 320 MHz bits when `band ==
  NL80211_BAND_6GHZ`. mac80211 strips 320 MHz bits when `bw_limit <
  320`. ath12k was the outlier that trusted firmware on 5 GHz.

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE

**Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?**
- Record: Yes. Tree is `v6.18.53` (`VERSION=6 PATCHLEVEL=18
  SUBLEVEL=53`). `git merge-base --is-ancestor eaf478b3ea68 v6.18.53` is
  false — the fix is not in 6.18.53. Parent of the candidate still has
  the old if-only-6 GHz OR. `1476014fadb662` and `d4e244c85e45df` *are*
  in v6.18. Bug exists here.

**Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS**
- Record: Clean apply. Context in this tree matches (function at ~4937).
  All masks exist in `include/linux/ieee80211-eht.h`. Expected
  difficulty: clean apply.

**Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE**
- Record: No other commit in this tree clears these bits in
  `ath12k_wmi_eht_caps_parse()`. `ath12k_mac_filter_eht_cap_mesh()` only
  strips some CAP7 bits for mesh iftypes, not CAP0 320 MHz-in-6 GHz, so
  it does not replace this fix.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: SUBSYSTEM AND CRITICALITY**
- Record: `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k` — Qualcomm Wi-Fi 7.
  Criticality: IMPORTANT (production Wi-Fi 7, not core mm/net).
  `CONFIG_ATH12K`.

**Step 7.2: SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY**
- Record: Active (many 2026 ath12k WMI commits). This bug is old (v6.6),
  not a regression from brand-new code.

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: WHO IS AFFECTED**
- Record: ath12k users, especially split-phy QCN9274 5 GHz (author’s
  case) and any firmware that sets 320 MHz bits in the 2.4/5 GHz WMI
  blob. Not universal.

**Step 8.2: TRIGGER CONDITIONS**
- Record: Device probe / cap parse whenever firmware reports those bits.
  Common on affected SKUs. Unprivileged users do not get a kernel
  exploit; they get wrong `iw` output and wrong beacon IEs. Not a race.

**Step 8.3: FAILURE MODE SEVERITY**
- Record: Not a panic/UAF/deadlock. Kernel will not run 320 MHz on 5 GHz
  (`chan.c` requires 6 GHz; MLME 320 MHz limit is `is_6ghz && cap bit`).
  User impact is (1) wrong `iw phy`, (2) reserved bits in beacons, (3)
  extra 3-byte 320 MHz MCS/NSS field in the EHT Capabilities IE, which
  can confuse spec-compliant peers. Severity: MEDIUM (protocol/interop),
  not CRITICAL.

**Step 8.4: RISK-BENEFIT RATIO**
- Benefit: medium for QCN9274/mesh/AP users; stops malformed EHT IEs.
  Risk: very low (~15 lines, reserved-bit clears, reviewed, tested).
  Ratio: favorable.

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: EVIDENCE**

FOR:
- Real hardware bug (QCN9274), user-visible `iw phy` and mesh beacons
- Malformed EHT Capabilities IE (reserved bit + extra MCS/NSS bytes) —
  interoperability, not just cosmetics
- Small, obviously correct, constants and function exist in 6.18
- Reviewed by Qualcomm; applied by Jeff Johnson; Johannes agrees it is a
  driver firmware workaround
- No new API; no prerequisites missing in this tree
- Analogous to a hardware/firmware quirk

AGAINST:
- Not a crash, leak, UAF, deadlock, or CVE
- Johannes noted most extra 320 MHz bits are unused at runtime; cfg80211
  already blocks 320 MHz off 6 GHz
- Author never added `Fixes:` even after Rameshkumar asked
- Affects one driver / specific firmware behavior

UNRESOLVED:
- Direct lore.kernel.org HTTP fetch returned 403; discussion recovered
  via `b4` mbox
- No stable-list thread found

**Step 9.2: STABLE RULES CHECKLIST**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — masks match the spec;
   Tested-on QCN9274; two Qualcomm Reviewed-by
2. Fixes a real bug that affects users? **PASS** — observed wrong caps
   and wrong beacons
3. Important issue? **PASS** (medium) — OTA IE malformation/interop on
   Wi-Fi 7 APs/mesh, not a crash. Within “etc.” for driver protocol bugs
   / firmware quirks
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — 16 insertions, one function
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — code and symbols present;
   clean apply

**Step 9.3: EXCEPTION CATEGORIES**
- Record: Firmware/hardware workaround (quirk-like). Not a new device
  ID, DT, or build fix.

**Step 9.4: DECISION**
Backport to this 6.18.y tree. The bug is in 6.18, the fix is surgical,
and wrong EHT IEs on 5 GHz are a real user-visible protocol defect on
shipping QCN9274 hardware.
