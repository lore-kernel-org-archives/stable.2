[ Upstream commit a45cc646a3aa83eb4ab4c7ed2685785ea51dc5e6 ]

machine_constraints_voltage() currently applies apply_uV against the
machine-supplied [min_uV, max_uV] range, and only afterwards clamps
that range down to what the regulator can actually supply (via
ops->list_voltage()).

If the machine-supplied range is wider than the regulator's actual
range, apply_uV's rounding can pick a selector outside the (correct)
clamped range, so the regulator ends up programmed outside its clamped
min/max. At bring-up this shows up as a voltage read-back outside the
clamped range.

Fix this by moving the clamping block ahead of the apply_uV block, so
apply_uV always targets an already-clamped range. Whether apply_uV
should run is decided from the unclamped constraints beforehand and
stored in a local bool, since clamping must not itself change whether
apply_uV fires.

No functional change to the clamping logic itself, only its position
relative to apply_uV. Its early return 0 exits become fallthroughs
since the apply_uV logic now follows it.

# Stable Backport Analysis: `regulator: core: clamp voltage constraints
before applying apply_uV`

**Local tree:** `linux-6.18.y` at **6.18.44** (`git describe HEAD` →
`v6.18.44-2-g1b9e1abadee04`; `Makefile` → VERSION 6, PATCHLEVEL 18,
SUBLEVEL 44)

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE**

Record: `[regulator: core]` `[clamp]` — Reorder voltage constraint
clamping to run before `apply_uV` processing in
`machine_constraints_voltage()`.

**Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS**

Record:
- **Assisted-by:** Claude:claude-sonnet-5
- **Signed-off-by:** Kamal Wadhwa \<kamal.wadhwa@oss.qualcomm.com\>
- **Link:** https://patch.msgid.link/20260720-b4-regulator-core-clamp-
  voltage-v1-1-8e5eec076a8e@oss.qualcomm.com
- **Signed-off-by:** Mark Brown \<broonie@kernel.org\> (regulator
  subsystem maintainer)
- No Fixes:, Reported-by:, Tested-by:, Reviewed-by:, Acked-by:, or Cc:
  stable tags
- Notable: Maintainer sign-off; no fuzzer or user bug reports cited

**Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT**

Record:
- **Bug:** `machine_constraints_voltage()` runs `apply_uV` against
  unclamped `[min_uV, max_uV]`, then clamps to hardware-supported
  discrete voltages via `ops->list_voltage()`.
- **Symptom:** When machine constraints are wider than the regulator's
  real range, `apply_uV` rounding can select a voltage outside the
  clamped range — seen at bring-up as voltage read-back outside expected
  bounds; can also fail regulator registration.
- **Root cause:** Ordering bug — clamping must precede `apply_uV`.
- **Fix approach:** Move clamping before `apply_uV`; capture whether
  `apply_uV` should run in a `bool` before clamping mutates constraints
  (important for fixed-voltage autoconfigure).
- No explicit kernel version range in the message.

**Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES**

Record: **Not hidden** — this is an explicit correctness/ordering bug
fix, though described as "no functional change to the clamping logic
itself, only its position."

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS — LINE BY LINE

**Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES**

Record:
- **Files:** `drivers/regulator/core.c` only
- **Scope:** ~88 lines moved, ~8 lines added (`bool apply_uV` +
  comments); clamping block moved from after `apply_uV` to before it
- **Function modified:** `machine_constraints_voltage()`
- **Classification:** Single-file surgical reorder within one function

**Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE**

Record:
- **Hunk 1 (before → after):** `apply_uV` block ran first on raw machine
  constraints → clamping ran second. **After:** `apply_uV` decision
  captured upfront → clamping runs → `apply_uV` runs on already-clamped
  range.
- **Hunk 2:** Early `return 0` in clamping for optional constraints /
  continuous range → empty fallthrough blocks so `apply_uV` can still
  run when appropriate.
- **Execution path:** Regulator registration / probe
  (`set_machine_constraints()` → `machine_constraints_voltage()`), boot-
  time initialization.

**Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM**

Record:
- **Category:** Logic / correctness fix (ordering)
- **Mechanism:** `_regulator_do_set_voltage()` uses
  `regulator_map_voltage()` which maps `[min_uV, max_uV]` to a hardware
  selector. When `apply_uV` uses an overly-wide machine range on a
  discrete (`list_voltage` + `n_voltages`,
  non-`continuous_voltage_range`) regulator, the mapped selector/voltage
  may lie outside the subset the clamping pass would later compute.
  Result: wrong voltage programmed or `-EINVAL` on registration.

**Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY**

Record:
- **Quality:** Obviously correct — same clamping logic, correct order;
  `apply_uV` bool preserves pre-clamp decision semantics (explicitly
  handles fixed-voltage autoconfigure where clamping rewrites
  `min_uV`/`max_uV`).
- **Regression risk:** Low. Clamping validation errors (`-EINVAL`) now
  occur before hardware programming — strictly safer than before.
- **No API changes, no new sysfs/module parameters.**

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES**

Record: `git blame` shows `machine_constraints_voltage()` body
attributed to `5d324e5159d9e` (Nov 2025 merge importing
`drivers/regulator/core.c`). Both `apply_uV` block (line 1209) and
clamping block (line 1265) are present in current tree with buggy
ordering. **Exact commit that introduced the ordering bug:** not
determinable — tree history is shallow (file appears as wholesale
import). Bug is present in 6.18.44.

**Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG**

Record: No `Fixes:` tag present. N/A.

**Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY FOR RELATED CHANGES**

Record: Recent `drivers/regulator/core.c` commits on this tree include
locking fixes and supply-check reordering (`bde74af8d4466`,
`b6a83ad13d253`, etc.). No commit reordering clamp vs. `apply_uV`.
**Standalone fix, not part of a series** (subject has no "patch X/Y").

**Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR'S OTHER COMMITS**

Record: No other commits from Kamal Wadhwa in `drivers/regulator/` in
this tree. Mark Brown is the subsystem maintainer (signed off).

**Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENT/PREREQUISITE COMMITS**

Record: **No dependencies.** Fix only reorders existing code within
`machine_constraints_voltage()`. All structures (`apply_uV`,
`list_voltage`, `continuous_voltage_range`) exist in this tree. **Can
apply standalone.**

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: FIND THE ORIGINAL PATCH DISCUSSION**

Record: `b4 dig -c HEAD` failed (commit not in tree). `b4 dig` with
message-ID argument not supported by this b4 version. WebFetch and curl
to lore.kernel.org blocked by Anubis bot protection. **Could not
retrieve mailing list thread.** Link tag points to v1 submission
(2026-07-20).

**Step 4.2: CHECK WHO REVIEWED THE PATCH**

Record: **UNVERIFIED** — `b4 dig -w` could not be run without commit in
tree; lore inaccessible. Mark Brown (maintainer) Signed-off-by confirms
maintainer acceptance.

**Step 4.3: SEARCH FOR THE BUG REPORT**

Record: No Reported-by: or syzbot Link: tags. Bug described as bring-up
observation (voltage read-back outside clamped range). **No external bug
report verified.**

**Step 4.4: CHECK FOR RELATED PATCHES AND SERIES**

Record: v1 in message-ID; no evidence of multi-patch series. Standalone.

**Step 4.5: CHECK STABLE MAILING LIST HISTORY**

Record: **UNVERIFIED** — lore.kernel.org inaccessible.

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: IDENTIFY KEY FUNCTIONS IN THE DIFF**

Record: `machine_constraints_voltage()` (modified). Supporting context:
`_regulator_do_set_voltage()`, `regulator_map_voltage()`,
`set_machine_constraints()`, `regulator_register()` path.

**Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS**

Record:
- `set_machine_constraints()` → `machine_constraints_voltage()` (line
  1461)
- `set_machine_constraints()` called from regulator registration at
  lines 5954 and 5967 (`__regulator_register()` path)
- **Context:** Every regulator probe/registration with machine
  constraints; common on ARM/embedded with device tree.

**Step 5.3: TRACE CALLEES**

Record: Clamping calls `ops->list_voltage()` per selector. `apply_uV`
calls `regulator_get_voltage_rdev()` and `_regulator_do_set_voltage()` →
`regulator_map_voltage()` → driver `set_voltage_sel`/`set_voltage`.

**Step 5.4: FOLLOW THE CALL CHAIN**

Record: Device probe → `regulator_register()` / devm variant →
`set_machine_constraints()` → `machine_constraints_voltage()`. Triggered
at boot for every constrained regulator. **Not directly userspace-
triggerable**, but affects all platforms using DT `regulator-min-
microvolt` / `regulator-max-microvolt` (which auto-set `apply_uV = true`
in `of_regulator.c` lines 109–111).

**Step 5.5: SEARCH FOR SIMILAR PATTERNS**

Record: No similar ordering bug found elsewhere in
`drivers/regulator/core.c`. Current and suspend voltage paths use
already-clamped ranges.

---

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AGAINST THE LOCAL TREE

**Step 6.1: DOES THE BUGGY CODE EXIST IN THIS TREE?**

Record: **YES.** Current `drivers/regulator/core.c` lines 1208–1263 run
`apply_uV` before clamping (lines 1265–1334). The candidate fix is
**not** present (`git log --grep='clamp voltage'` returns nothing).

**Step 6.2: CHECK FOR BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS**

Record: **Clean apply expected.** Function structure in 6.18.44 matches
the patch context exactly. No conflicting changes to this function in
recent stable commits. Minor reorder only.

**Step 6.3: CHECK IF RELATED FIXES ARE ALREADY HERE**

Record: **No.** No alternative fix for this ordering issue in the tree.

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: IDENTIFY THE SUBSYSTEM AND ITS CRITICALITY**

Record: **Subsystem:** `drivers/regulator/core.c` — regulator framework
core. **Criticality: CORE/IMPORTANT** — affects power management for all
constrained regulators platform-wide.

**Step 7.2: ASSESS SUBSYSTEM ACTIVITY**

Record: Active — multiple regulator core fixes in 6.18.y (locking,
supply resolution, refcount leaks in individual drivers).

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: DETERMINE WHO IS AFFECTED**

Record: **Platform-specific but common** — boards using device tree
regulators with `regulator-min-microvolt` + `regulator-max-microvolt`
(auto-enables `apply_uV`) on discrete-voltage PMIC/LDO drivers
(`list_voltage` + `n_voltages`, not `continuous_voltage_range`).
Embedded, mobile, ARM SoCs.

**Step 8.2: DETERMINE THE TRIGGER CONDITIONS**

Record:
- `apply_uV` true (automatic from DT when min and max microvolt set)
- Discrete voltage table (`ops->list_voltage` && `n_voltages` &&
  !`continuous_voltage_range`)
- Machine `[min_uV, max_uV]` wider than regulator's actual supported
  discrete range
- **Likelihood:** Moderate on embedded bring-up; DT authors often
  specify wide permissible ranges
- **Userspace:** Not directly triggerable; boot/probe path only

**Step 8.3: DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE SEVERITY**

Record:
- **Probe failure:** `machine_constraints_voltage()` returns error →
  regulator registration fails → dependent devices fail probe → **boot
  failure** on affected boards. **Severity: HIGH/CRITICAL**
- **Wrong voltage programmed:** Hardware outside intended clamped range
  → instability or hardware damage risk. **Severity: HIGH**
- Not a crash/oops in the classical sense, but can prevent boot or
  misconfigure power rails.

**Step 8.4: CALCULATE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO**

Record:
- **Benefit:** HIGH for affected embedded platforms — prevents boot
  failures and incorrect voltage programming during regulator init
- **Risk:** LOW — reorder of existing logic, maintainer-reviewed, no new
  APIs
- **Ratio:** Strong benefit, minimal risk

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: COMPILE THE EVIDENCE**

**FOR backporting:**
- Real ordering bug verified in 6.18.44 source code
- Can cause regulator registration failure (boot broken) or wrong
  voltage at bring-up
- Core regulator framework — broad impact surface for affected configs
- Small, surgical, maintainer-signed fix
- No prerequisites; applies cleanly to this tree
- Fix makes error paths safer (validation before hardware programming)

**AGAINST backporting:**
- Trigger requires specific config combination (apply_uV + discrete
  voltages + wide machine range)
- No syzbot report or multiple user reports in commit message
- Bring-up issue primarily (though affects production DT configs)
- Mailing list review details unverified

**UNRESOLVED:**
- Full lore review thread inaccessible
- Exact age of the ordering bug (shallow git history)

**Step 9.2: STABLE RULES CHECKLIST**

1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — logic reorder is clear;
   maintainer SOB; no Tested-by but mechanism is verifiable
2. Fixes a real bug affecting users? **PASS** — probe failure / wrong
   voltage on affected boards
3. Important issue? **PASS** — boot failure and incorrect power-rail
   programming (HIGH severity)
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — single function in one file, no logic
   rewrite
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**
6. Can apply to the local tree? **PASS** — buggy code present, fix not
   applied, clean apply expected

**Step 9.3: EXCEPTION CATEGORIES**

Record: None (not device ID, quirk, DT, build, or docs). Standard bug
fix.

**Step 9.4: DECISION RATIONALE**

For **linux-6.18.y (6.18.44)**, the buggy ordering is present in
`machine_constraints_voltage()`. The fix reorders existing clamping
logic ahead of `apply_uV` so voltage selection always targets hardware-
valid ranges — preventing registration failures and incorrect voltage
programming on discrete regulators with wide DT constraints. This is a
real, important correctness bug in the regulator core, with a low-risk
surgical fix and maintainer approval. The lack of syzbot reports does
not diminish the verified code-level bug.
