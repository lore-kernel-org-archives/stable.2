6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit 2005aabe94eaab8608879d98afb901bc99bc3a31 ]

When all files are closed, functionfs needs ffs_data_reset() to be
done before any further opens are allowed.

During that time we have ffs->state set to FFS_CLOSING; that makes
->open() fail with -EBUSY.  Once ffs_data_reset() is done, it
switches state (to FFS_READ_DESCRIPTORS) indicating that opening
that thing is allowed again.  There's a couple of additional twists:
	* mounting with -o no_disconnect delays ffs_data_reset()
from doing that at the final ->release() to the first subsequent
open().  That's indicated by ffs->state set to FFS_DEACTIVATED;
if open() sees that, it immediately switches to FFS_CLOSING and
proceeds with doing ffs_data_reset() before returning to userland.
	* a couple of usb callbacks need to force the delayed
transition; unfortunately, they are done in locking environment
that does not allow blocking and ffs_data_reset() can block.
As the result, if these callbacks see FFS_DEACTIVATED, they change
state to FFS_CLOSING and use schedule_work() to get ffs_data_reset()
executed asynchronously.

Unfortunately, the locking is rather insufficient.  A fix attempted
in e5bf5ee26663 ("functionfs: fix the open/removal races") had closed
a bunch of UAF, but it didn't do anything to the callbacks, lacked
barriers in transition from FFS_CLOSING to FFS_READ_DESCRIPTORS
_and_ it had been too heavy-handed in open()/open() serialization -
I've used ffs->mutex for that, and it's being held over actual IO on
ep0, complete with copy_from_user(), etc.

Even more unfortunately, the userland side is apparently racy enough
to have the resulting timing changes (no failures, just a delayed
return of open(2)) disrupt the things quite badly.  Userland bugs
or not, it's a clear regression that needs to be dealt with.

Solution is to use a spinlock for serializing these state checks and
transitions - unlike ffs->mutex it can be taken in these callbacks
and it doesn't disrupt the timings in open().

We could introduce a new spinlock, but it's easier to use the one
that is already there (ffs->eps_lock) instead - the locking
environment is safe for it in all affected places.

Since now it is held over all places that alter or check the
open count (ffs->opened), there's no need to keep that atomic_t -
int would serve just fine and it's simpler that way.
