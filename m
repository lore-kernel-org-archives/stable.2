From: Karl Mehltretter <kmehltretter@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 78db93943210df61c8446aae35af6836e2cf04aa ]

Commit e9895609cb7f ("wind ->s_roots via ->d_sib instead of ->d_hash")
moved secondary roots from ->d_hash to ->d_sib.  Secondary roots are now
d_unhashed(), so __d_drop() returns without removing them from
->s_roots.  Consequently, d_drop() in do_one_tree() no longer
guarantees progress through the list.

If a secondary root is still busy once do_one_tree() is done with it,
its final dput() cannot evict it.  The root remains ->s_roots.first and
the loop selects it forever, holding ->s_umount for write and repeatedly
reporting the same dentry.

The root does not need a leaked reference of its own for that.  Every
child pins its parent (d_alloc() takes a reference on it) and
umount_check() deliberately reports a busy descendant instead of
complaining about its ancestors, so a single leaked dentry reference
anywhere below a secondary root is enough.  For filesystems that build
->s_root with d_obtain_root() - nfs, ceph, nilfs2 snapshot mounts -
that is the entire tree.

Before e9895609cb7f, ___d_drop() special-cased IS_ROOT dentries and
removed them from ->s_roots regardless of their refcount, so the
d_drop() in do_one_tree() detached the root from the superblock no
matter what.  Commit 9c8c10e262e0 ("more graceful recovery in
umount_collect()") deliberately made busy dentries nonfatal: report
them and finish the unmount rather than BUG() while holding
->s_umount.

Restore that by detaching the root in do_one_tree() itself, next to
the d_drop() that used to do it.  That covers both callers - the
->s_roots loop and ->s_root, which for the filesystems above is a
secondary root as well.  In the normal case dentry_unlist() finds
->d_sib already unhashed when eviction occurs.

A permanently leaked reference remains leaked after unmount, as it did
before e9895609cb7f; if the extra reference is merely delayed, its
final dput() may run after teardown has advanced.  Leaving the root on
->s_roots is not an alternative: the superblock would then be freed
with a live dentry still linked into it, and that dentry's
dentry_unlist() would take ->s_roots_lock on freed memory.

Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org> says:
Moved the ->s_roots removal from the shrink_dcache_for_umount() loop
into do_one_tree(), so a busy ->s_root obtained from d_obtain_root() is
detached on the first pass instead of being reported a second time when
the loop picks it off ->s_roots.  Extended the commit message with the
pinned-ancestor case.
