Just because it may have another source of entropy doesn't mean its
security strength is higher than 64 bits.

I cannot find any documentation other than
https://datasheet.octopart.com/PPC460EX-SUB800T-AMCC-datasheet-11553412.pdf
which says "ANSI X9.17 Annex C compliant using a DES algorithm".

DES actually has a 56-bit key, so maybe I was over-generous.

And according to https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap5.pdf ANSI
X9.17 has only a 64-bit state anyway.  So even if we assume the
datasheet is incorrect and the algorithm is actually 3DES which has a
longer key, the state is likely still 64-bit.

So it isn't looking good.  And since it's an undocumented proprietary
design it shouldn't be given the benefit of the doubt either.

That's not related to this patch.
