Agreed. Other callers face the same 32-bit concern, so a wrapper that does the 
statically_true(...) check once would be cleaner than open-coding a conditional 
in each site.

No — these three checks fail all the time in normal operation, so I'd
keep the branch:

if (parent_effective > siblings_protected &&
	parent_usage > siblings_protected &&
	usage > protected) {

Checks 1 and 3 just ask "is there anything left to distribute?". Often
there isn't, so they fail routinely.

Check 2 is a divide-by-zero guard. parent_usage - siblings_protected is
the divisor. A conditional-move can't replace it: the division would run
anyway and only get multiplied by zero afterwards, so we'd still divide
by zero when the two are equal. The branch is what stops us reaching the
division.

Agreed, and the min() already ensures that. It caps the value so the
result can never be larger than unclaimed. Avoiding the trap is just a
bonus of that same cap.

So I'll keep the patch as-is. Thanks for the review!
