7.2-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Stefan Metzmacher <metze@samba.org>

[ Upstream commit 4ca76b89917ad5b317e07ae4f0edc16f7c2a1248 ]

smbdirect_socket_destroy_sync() waited for RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED
after smbdirect_socket_cleanup_work() called rdma_disconnect(). That
can take very long, e.g. if the peer just disappeared, until the
rdma cm gives up, or forever if the event already happened, but the
status was overwritten afterwards.

This is not needed: smbdirect_socket_destroy() drains the qp under
rdma_lock_handler(), destroys it and calls rdma_destroy_id(), which
only waits for a currently running event handler and makes sure no
further events are delivered. The rest of the disconnect protocol
(DREQ/DREP and timewait for IB, abrupt close for iWarp) is handled
by the rdma core asynchronously. drivers/nvme/host/rdma.c also just
calls rdma_disconnect() and ib_drain_qp() before rdma_destroy_id().

So smbdirect_socket_destroy() now also accepts
SMBDIRECT_SOCKET_DISCONNECTING and changes the status to
SMBDIRECT_SOCKET_DISCONNECTED itself under rdma_lock_handler().

We could still get RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED in the small
windows between rdma_unlock_handler() and rdma_destroy_id(),
but in that case smbdirect_connection_rdma_event_handler()
is basically a no-op.
