I assume these are standard PCIe devices, but this architected error
state doesn't sound like something from the PCIe spec.

DPC works by disabling the link, but of course that blocks traffic to
all the functions of an MFD, so maybe this is some s390-specific thing
outside the endpoint, e.g., something in a Downstream Port that can
selectively block traffic to/from a specific function?

To get to pci_reset_bus_function() where we can use the slot reset, I
think all the previous methods, including pcie_reset_flr(), must have
failed with -ENOTTY.  But I don't see a place that would do that.
Maybe you remove the other methods from dev->reset_methods[]?

In addition to whatever the CLP Set PCI Function Disable/Enable
hypercall does to unblock traffic to/from the endpoint, I suppose it
does an FLR internally?  It must use some standard PCIe mechanism
because the endpoint doesn't know anything about s390 or the
hypervisor.

I wonder if we should make some kind of direct platform-specific reset
method, or maybe a pcibios_*()-style hook in the pcie_reset_flr() path
instead of this somewhat convoluted pci_slot stuff.  But
s390_pci_hpc.c is pretty simple and maybe it's used for things other
than reset.
