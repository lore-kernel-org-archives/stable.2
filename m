From: Joseph Qi <joseph.qi@linux.alibaba.com>

[ Upstream commit f48151da595e74efdc23d83d8d6d142207b8c731 ]

Patch series "ocfs2: fix stale xattr entry pointers and empty header
reads", v1.

Five defects in the ocfs2 extended attribute code, plus one robustness
measure that belongs with them, all on the paths that move entries
between a block, a bucket and an index tree.  They fall into two groups.

Stale entry pointers (patches 1 to 3)

ocfs2_xa_set() writes through a pointer into xh_entries[] that two of
its callers invalidate first.  Defragmenting a bucket ends in a sort()
on xe_name_hash, and lib/sort.c is an unstable heapsort, so entries that
share a hash can trade slots.  Copying a block into a bucket changes the
order outright, since a block holds its entries in insertion order while
a bucket holds them by hash, yet ocfs2_xattr_update_xattr_search()
relocates the search by the index the entry had in the block.  Neither
path compares the entry's name with the one being set, so setxattr() can
replace a neighbouring attribute's value and still report success, or
trip ocfs2_xa_reuse_entry()'s BUG_ON.  Patch 1 takes the hash before the
sort; patches 2 and 3 look the entry up again afterwards.

Reads of an empty entry array (patches 4 to 6)

A block and a bucket may both hold no entries: ocfs2_xa_remove_entry()
keeps the last slot when it removes the only one, so an empty bucket
still carries the hash it is keyed by.  Three sites index xh_entries[]
without checking xh_count and so read xh_entries[-1], which lands on the
header and comes back as xh_count | xh_free_start << 16.  Nothing
faults, but the value is acted on: the collision check reports no
collision for an empty bucket, the divide commits a sentinel hash that
hides part of the key space from ocfs2_xattr_bucket_find(), and the
block to bucket copy claims storage the bucket does not hold.  Patches 4
to 6 guard each site and keep the one read of xh_entries[0] that
ocfs2_xa_remove_entry() documents as intentional.

This patch (of 6):

ocfs2_xattr_set_entry_index_block() takes the hash a bucket split has to
work with out of xs->here, but only after ocfs2_xattr_set_entry_bucket()
has tried and failed to fit the entry.  That call defragments the bucket
when it runs out of room, and ocfs2_defrag_xattr_bucket() finishes by
sorting the entry array by name hash.  lib/sort.c is not stable, so two
entries sharing a hash may trade slots and xs->here is left naming an
entry other than the one the search found.

The hash value itself survives the permutation -- the array is already
sorted, so a slot can only exchange with an equal-hash neighbour -- but
there is no reason to depend on that.  Pick the hash up before the set,
where xs->here is unambiguously the entry the search landed on.

No functional change intended.
