Subject: mm/page_alloc: avoid direct compaction for costly __GFP_NORETRY allocations
Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2026 14:21:02 +0000

Commit 5d8edfb900d5 ("iomap: Copy larger chunks from userspace")
introduced high-order folio allocations in the iomap buffered write path. 
When memory is fragmented, each failed costly-order allocation enters
__alloc_pages_slowpath() which runs direct compaction and
drain_all_pages(), causing a 0.38x throughput drop on PostgreSQL pgbench
(simple-update) with 1024 clients on a 96-vCPU arm64 system.

The root issue is that direct compaction is too expensive for hot
allocation paths that have fallbacks to smaller allocations. 
__filemap_get_folio_mpol() already marks higher-order allocations with
__GFP_NORETRY | __GFP_NOWARN, signalling that the caller can handle
failure.  However, the page allocator still attempts full direct
compaction for costly orders with __GFP_NORETRY, which is unnecessarily
aggressive when the caller will simply retry at a lower order.

For costly-order allocations with __GFP_NORETRY, suppress direct reclaim
for the whole slowpath by computing can_direct_reclaim (and hence
can_compact) as false.  The !can_direct_reclaim check near the top of the
slowpath then short-circuits to nopage: no direct reclaim, no direct
compaction and no drain_all_pages() IPI across every CPU.  kswapd (and in
turn kcompactd) is still woken further down for background
defragmentation, so compaction keeps working for long-term system health
while being removed from the latency-critical direct allocation path.

Allocations that also request __GFP_THISNODE are exempted.  That flag
pairing identifies the local-node-first THP attempt issued by
alloc_pages_mpol() (mempolicy.c), which relies on direct compaction to
form transparent huge pages.  __GFP_NOFAIL is exempted as well, so a
must-not-fail allocation is never made to fail.

Test environment:
  Hardware:  AWS EC2 m8g.24xlarge (96 vCPU, arm64)
             12x 1TB IO2 32000 IOPS RAID0 XFS
  OS:        AL2023
  Kernel:    v7.3-rc1
  Database:  PostgreSQL 18.4
  Workload:  pgbench simple-update, 1024 clients, 96 threads, 1200s

Results (average of 3 runs, TPS):
  Config                                       Avg TPS   % vs baseline
  AL2023 stock 6.1 kernel (pre-5d8edfb900d5)   136,942           n/a
  v7.3-rc1 baseline (no patch)                  59,408             -
  v7.3-rc1 + this patch                        161,994       +172.7%

The patch fully recovers the pre-5d8edfb900d5 performance, bringing
throughput back above the pre-regression level and well clear of the ~59k
baseline.  The AL2023 6.1 row runs a kernel that predates commit
5d8edfb900d5 ("iomap: Copy larger chunks from userspace"), so it is not
directly comparable, but it shows the pre-regression level and confirms
that the ~59k baseline is the anomaly and not the norm.
