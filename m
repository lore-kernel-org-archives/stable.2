6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

commit 61606f8846a9da8ab7d2d36ff4617134c9d6df1b upstream.

LOLLM pointed out an inconsistency in the block reservation code in
xrep_rtbitmap.  The first is that the reservation computation is not
consistent between the code that sets up the repair and the code that
tries to avoid exceeding the transaction reservation once we know how
big the rtbitmap really must be.  As a result, the logic doesn't work.

In fixing that, a second problem emerges: if we do readjust, we ask for
the entire reservation all over again.  We really only need the delta,
so ask only for that.

Fix all these problems by hoisting the computation to a trivial helper
so that it gets used in both places.
