Subject: [PATCH v6 3/8] ksmbd: use the channel signing key for session setup on a bound channel

smb3_check_sign_req() always uses the session signing key for
SESSION_SETUP, and smb3_set_sign_rsp() does for every SESSION_SETUP
response but the final one of a binding. That is right for a binding
request and its non-final responses (MS-SMB2 3.3.5.2.4, 3.3.5.5.3), but
a reauthentication sent on a channel that is already bound is then also
verified and signed with the session key instead of that channel's
key.

Use the session key for binding requests, for their non-final
responses, and for SESSION_SETUP on a connection that is not yet a
channel of the session. Use the channel key for everything else on a
channel, as the Samba client and smbd do. MS-SMB2 does not give one key
for a reauthentication on such a channel: 3.3.5.2.4 has the server
verify the request with Channel.SigningKey, while 3.2.4.1.1 has the
client sign it with Session.SigningKey. 3.3.4.1.1 has the server sign a
SESSION_SETUP response with Session.SigningKey unless its status is
STATUS_SUCCESS, and 3.3.5.5.3 the final response of a non-binding
session setup too. The two keys only differ on a channel that was bound
to the session, and that case has not been tested against Windows.

The signature of a reauthentication was not checked at all, because
SESSION_SETUP is exempt from the check in __process_request(). A
reauthentication of a live session with a forged signature therefore got
STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED signed with the session key, with or
without multichannel: the same kind of signing oracle as an unverified
binding request. Verify it with the same helper as binding requests.
Also refuse an unsigned reauthentication of a session that requires
signing, as smbtorture's bind_negative tests expect from Windows, unless
the request arrived encrypted with that session's key. A related
operation in an encrypted compound may name another session than the one
whose key encrypted it, so compare the session of the transform header
too. A session that negotiated encryption has sess->sign cleared even
when signing was required when it was set up, so remember that in
sess->sign_required and take it and enforced encryption into account
too; merely having negotiated encryption is not enough, since clients
such as the Linux one always offer it and then send unsigned,
unencrypted requests. Do not expire the session when a check fails,
since the request did not come from its owner.

The checks apply to every session that has been authenticated before,
which is one that has a user, including while a reauthentication of an
expired session is in progress.

smb2_sess_setup() copied conn->binding into
work->session_setup_binding after its error path had cleared it, so the
response to a failed binding request was signed and added to the
preauth integrity hash as if the request had not been a binding one.
conn->binding is also not yet set when a binding request fails early,
and is left set after a binding has completed on the connection. Take
the value from the request instead.

An AI assistant was used to draft the patch and as an independent
reviewer.
