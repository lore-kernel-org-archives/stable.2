Thanks. I had to bump up the concurrency a bit and then was able to
reproduce.

The patch I sent survived my regression testing but when taking another
look at the upstream patch, I realized something else I had previously
missed. The code in master doesn't actually return -EAGAIN directly
along with partial completion. It just returns the partial completion,
loops again in iomap, and then presumably returns -EAGAIN at that point
which makes its way back to io_uring. I think that is mostly harmless
but technically a bug in the upstream patch as the intent was to be able
to advance the iter, return -EAGAIN, and let the operation unwind from
there.

I think this actually leaves at least a couple options here. One is that
we could presumably just do the same thing on stable as current master:
forget the flag and just remove the iov revert and direct -EAGAIN return
at the cost of one more iter before returning to the caller. Another is
to fix up the code in master and use the patch I posted as a customized
stable backport of that.

WRT the latter I suppose we could also just stick with this patch for
stable and I can follow up with a separate patch for the loop thing on
master. Hmm.. I want to think about it a little more so if any iomap
folks have Opinions in the meantime, let me know.
