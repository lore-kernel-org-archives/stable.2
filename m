[ Upstream commit 0fa55c5539173bceaeb400c69b1974aaa0cdb8dc ]

For a shared cpufreq policy, dbs_update() derives the load used for the
frequency decision from the maximum load among its CPUs, but it may
also record deferred idle periods accumulated by an idle CPU in the
policy.

Consequently, a single update can contain both a high decision load
from one CPU and multiple deferred idle periods from another CPU. The
conservative governor applies the deferred down steps before evaluating
the decision load. If that load subsequently triggers an up step, the
deferred down steps can outweigh the single up step and produce a net
frequency reduction.

This was observed on a policy shared by CPUs 2 and 3. A CPU-bound
SCHED_EXT task kept CPU 2 fully utilized while CPU 3 remained idle.
On this system, SCHED_EXT generated update-util callbacks less
frequently than CFS, resulting in sparse DBS updates such as:

 load=100 idle_periods=7 interval=59 ms
 load=100 idle_periods=4 interval=39 ms
 load=100 idle_periods=2 interval=19 ms
 load=100 idle_periods=7 interval=59 ms

With the default 5% frequency step and a 2.6 GHz policy maximum, seven
deferred periods reduce the requested frequency by seven 130 MHz steps
before the high decision load adds only one step. Repeated updates
therefore keep the policy near 530 MHz even though CPU 2 is fully
utilized.

There are two load values relevant to this behavior:

  * sample_load is calculated from the busy and elapsed time of the
    current sample.

  * decision_load is returned by dbs_update() for the governor's
    frequency decision. After a long idle interval, it may reuse
    prev_load to improve the response to a waking task and can therefore
    differ from sample_load.

The problem is that idle_periods is derived from accumulated idle time
and is applied independently of whether the current sample load is in
the conservative governor's downscaling region. A high sample load and
multiple deferred idle periods can therefore coexist, particularly
when updates are sparse.

As suggested by Zhongqiu Han, calculate the sample load separately from
the decision load. If no time has elapsed, use prev_load for the sample
load as the existing load calculation does, since no load can be
calculated for that interval.

Record the maximum sample load for the policy and apply deferred down
steps only when it is below down_threshold. This makes deferred
downscaling follow the same threshold that the conservative governor
normally uses to determine whether the policy load is low enough to
reduce the frequency.

The existing code applies deferred down steps whenever idle_periods is
valid, regardless of the sample load. When the decision load is in the
hold region, the locally adjusted frequency is not submitted unless
another frequency-update branch is taken. Thus, when the sample and
decision loads are the same and both are in the hold region, this
change does not alter the requested frequency.

The difference becomes visible when the decision load causes a
frequency update. In particular, if it exceeds up_threshold, the
governor applies a single up step after the deferred down steps and
submits the resulting request. Multiple deferred down steps can then
outweigh that up step and cause a frequency reduction even when the
sample load is above down_threshold.

With this change, deferred down steps are skipped whenever the maximum
sample load is at or above down_threshold, keeping deferred downscaling
consistent with the conservative governor's threshold semantics. The
requested frequency may therefore be higher than with the existing
behavior when deferred idle periods are present and the decision load
causes a frequency update. This is intentional, because the lower
request previously resulted from applying deferred downscaling while
the sampled policy load was outside the governor's downscaling region.
Accelerated deferred downscaling remains available when the policy
sample load is below down_threshold, including after a workload has
completed and the policy has become idle.
