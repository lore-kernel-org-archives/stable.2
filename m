------------------

From: Vineet Gupta <vineet.gupta@linux.dev>

[ Upstream commit 3a59f11e0f989bdd637c87151992605a6559a7cb ]

vmtest.sh captures the trailing command with command="$@", which flattens
the arguments into a single space-separated string, and then pastes it
into the generated guest init script:

        cd /root/bpf
        echo ${command}
        stdbuf -oL -eL ${command}

That here-doc is unquoted, so the host expands ${command} and the
flattened text lands in the script verbatim. The guest bash then parses
those lines as shell source, re-splitting the text on whitespace and
glob-expanding it against /root/bpf. As a result any command with a glob
or an argument containing spaces is corrupted before it reaches the test
binary. For example:

        vmtest.sh -- ./test_progs -a 'verifier_*'

has 'verifier_*' expanded in the guest into the matching object/skeleton
files (verifier_align.bpf.o verifier_align.skel.h ...), so test_progs is
handed a list of filenames instead of the intended name filter and runs no
matching tests.

Quote each argument with printf '%q ' so the command is reproduced
verbatim inside the VM: the escaped text goes through exactly one round
of quote removal when the guest parses the init script, yielding the
original argv with globs and special characters intact. The common case
(e.g. -t <name>) is unaffected.

Only do this when there is a command to quote. printf '%q ' with no
arguments still applies the format once and emits '', which the -s
(debug shell) path would take for a real command and try to run.

Note this makes the trailing command strictly an argv rather than a shell
snippet: passing it pre-quoted as one word, e.g.

        vmtest.sh -- "./test_progs -t foo"

no longer works, and neither does embedding guest-side shell syntax such
as ';' or a redirection. 'sh -c ...' still works.

The RV64 recipe in README.rst does depend on the old double parse: it
wraps the denylist in \" so the literal quotes reach the guest, whose
second parse of the init script removes them. Under %q those quotes now
survive into argv, and parse_test_list() strtok_r()s on ',' turns them
into junk filters:

        -d ",exceptions,"  ->  ["] [exceptions] ["]

That is harmless for DENYLIST.riscv64 only because its first line is a
comment, so the leading field is empty. A denylist starting with a real
entry would silently lose it - ["*arena*] never matches - so drop the
backslashes and let the host consume the quotes instead.
