This patch is still piling hack on hack.  We haven't made a serious
effort to understand what's going on, we're just adjusting flags until
things stop sucking.

What we know:
 - Doing compaction every time (which is what we currently do)
   performs badly
 - Doing compaction once at the requested large size and then not
   again until the smallest size also performs badly.  So it's not
   that we're doing too much compaction, it's that we're doing
   compaction at all.

But we don't know why compaction is performing badly.  For example,
we could specify MIGRATE_ASYNC or MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT if __GFP_NORETRY
is set.  Just as a reminder, here's how __GFP_NORETRY is documented:

 * %__GFP_NORETRY: The VM implementation will try only very lightweight
 * memory direct reclaim to get some memory under memory pressure (thus
 * it can sleep). It will avoid disruptive actions like OOM killer. The
 * caller must handle the failure which is quite likely to happen under
 * heavy memory pressure. The flag is suitable when failure can easily be
 * handled at small cost, such as reduced throughput.

So the callers aren't doing anything unreasonable when they say
__GFP_NORETRY.  It's the page allocator (and apparently the compaction
side of it) that's not living up to the documented contract.

So that's one approach which has not, as far as I can tell, been
investigated.

The other thing that icks me about this patch is how complex the
condition is:

> +	/*
> +	 * Costly __GFP_NORETRY callers have a cheap fallback, so don't stall
> +	 * them in reclaim or compaction. __GFP_THISNODE callers are exempt.
> +	 */
> +	if (costly_order && (gfp_mask & __GFP_NORETRY) &&
> +	    !(gfp_mask & __GFP_THISNODE))
> +		gfp_mask &= ~__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM;

So basically we're saying that __GFP_NORETRY means don't do compaction
unless __GFP_THISNODE is set, which is just special pleading.  Surely
the right answer is to remove __GFP_NORETRY from the one caller which
needs __GFP_THISNODE?


A slightly unrelated critique of this patch is that it's far too
complicated for what it does.  We could achieve the same thing by doing:

 static inline bool gfp_compaction_allowed(gfp_t gfp_mask)
 {
-       return IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_COMPACTION) && (gfp_mask & __GFP_IO);
+       return IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_COMPACTION) && (gfp_mask & __GFP_IO) &&
+               (!(gfp_mask & __GFP_NORETRY) || (gfp_mask & __GFP_THISNODE));
 }


Something I've been noodling on the past day or so is cleaning up the
GFP flags for "how hard to reclaim".  We currently have five
possibilities encoded in four bits:

1. No direct reclaim (__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM clear)
2. Light reclaim (__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM | __GFP_NORETRY)
3. Normal reclaim (__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM)
4. Extra reclaim (__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM | ___GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL)
5. Reclaim forever (__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM | __GFP_NOFAIL)

Clearly we can save ourselves a GFP flag bit by encoding those five
options into three bits.  Some of the code that manipulates "how hard to
reclaim" will need to be adjusted, but it shouldn't be that many places
to change.

If we do that, we can insert more options into the mix if they're really
needed.  Like we could have:

0 - No direct reclaim
1 - Light reclaim, no compaction
2 - Light reclaim with compaction
3 - Normal reclaim
4 - Extra reclaim
5 - Reclaim forever

and we'd still have two extra states in case we need to add more
flavours.
