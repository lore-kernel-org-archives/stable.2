[ Upstream commit 38cd651ebce7065a81c7e950d9e2ea1572304605 ]

It doesn't make sense to handle an alert event when the peripheral is
not attached. The slave->status could be SDW_SLAVE_ATTACHED or
SDW_SLAVE_ALERT when it is attached on the bus.

# Stable Backport Analysis: `soundwire: only handle alert events when
the peripheral is attached`

**Local tree:** `v6.18.44` (`stable/linux-6.18.y`, detached HEAD)
**Upstream commit:** `38cd651ebce70` (not yet in this tree)
**Verdict target:** Should `38cd651ebce70` be backported to **this**
6.18.y tree?

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

### Step 1.1: Subject line
**Record:** `[soundwire] [handle/prevent] only handle alert events when
the peripheral is attached` — subsystem is SoundWire bus core; action is
defensive filtering of alert handling.

### Step 1.2: Tags
**Record:**
- **Fixes:** — none
- **Reported-by:** — none
- **Tested-by:** — none
- **Reviewed-by:** Péter Ujfalusi, Ranjani Sridharan, Pierre-Louis
  Bossart
- **Acked-by:** — none
- **Link:** https://patch.msgid.link/20260520025720.1999367-1-yung-
  chuan.liao@linux.intel.com
- **Cc: stable:** — none (expected for manual review)
- **Signed-off-by:** Bard Liao (author), Vinod Koul (maintainer); ignore
  pipeline-added SOBs

Notable: three Intel SoundWire reviewers plus subsystem maintainer
Pierre-Louis Bossart.

### Step 1.3: Body analysis
**Record:**
- **Bug:** Alert events are processed even when the peripheral is not
  attached on the bus.
- **Symptom:** Spurious alert handling on unattached slaves; author
  later clarified this is seen rarely during suspend/resume testing
  (mailing list).
- **Root cause (author):** `slave->status` should only be
  `SDW_SLAVE_ATTACHED` or `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` when the peripheral is
  actually attached; otherwise alert handling is nonsensical.
- **Version info:** none in commit message.

### Step 1.4: Hidden bug fix?
**Record:** Yes. Although the subject does not say "fix", this is a
correctness/race-condition guard. Mailing-list follow-up confirms a real
suspend/resume race where `sdw_handle_slave_alerts()` runs while the
peripheral is still `SDW_SLAVE_UNATTACHED`.

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

### Step 2.1: Inventory
**Record:**
- **Files:** `drivers/soundwire/bus.c` (+4 / -0)
- **Function:** `sdw_handle_slave_status()`
- **Scope:** Single-file, surgical fix in one `switch` case.

### Step 2.2: Code flow change
**Record:**
- **Hunk (`SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` case):**
  - **Before:** Any hardware-reported `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` immediately
    calls `sdw_handle_slave_alerts(slave)`.
  - **After:** Alert handling is skipped (`continue`) unless
    `slave->status` is `SDW_SLAVE_ATTACHED` or `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT`.
  - **Path affected:** IRQ/work-driven bus status processing during
    enumeration, attach/detach, and suspend/resume.

### Step 2.3: Bug mechanism
**Record:**
- **Category:** Logic/correctness + race-condition guard.
- **Mechanism:** Without the check, a spurious or raced
  `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` status from hardware is acted on while the driver's
  view of the slave is still `SDW_SLAVE_UNATTACHED`.
  `sdw_handle_slave_alerts()` then:
  1. Forces `slave->status` to `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` via
     `sdw_modify_slave_status()`.
  2. Calls `pm_runtime_get_sync()`.
  3. Performs register I/O (`sdw_read_no_pm`, etc.) on a device not
     attached on the bus.

This is inconsistent with other code in the same file that already skips
unattached slaves.

### Step 2.4: Fix quality
**Record:**
- **Quality:** High. Matches an established pattern already used
  elsewhere in `bus.c` (clock-stop paths at lines 1074–1076, 1129–1130,
  etc.).
- **Regression risk:** Low. Only suppresses alert processing when the
  driver already believes the slave is not attached.
- **Note from review:** Pierre-Louis Bossart said the patch is "probably
  not enough but it's not wrong either" and still gave `Reviewed-by`.

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

### Step 3.1: Blame
**Record:**
- `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` handling without guard introduced in `b0a9c37b0178b`
  ("soundwire: Add slave status handling", 2017-12-14).
- That commit is an ancestor of this tree; the buggy pattern has been
  present since early SoundWire bus support.

### Step 3.2: Fixes: tag
**Record:** N/A — no `Fixes:` tag.

### Step 3.3: Related file history
**Record:**
- Related prior guard pattern: `929cfee314d15` "soundwire: bus:
  clock_stop: don't deal with UNATTACHED Slave devices"
- Related unattached-peripheral fix already in this tree:
  `d3896c944338c` "soundwire: don't program SDW_SCP_BUSCLOCK_SCALE on a
  unattached Peripheral" (same author, same class of bug)
- Standalone 1/1 patch; no series dependency.

### Step 3.4: Author context
**Record:** Bard Liao is an active Intel SoundWire contributor with
multiple fixes in this subsystem, including the already-backported
unattached-peripheral guard in `stream.c`.

### Step 3.5: Prerequisites
**Record:** No prerequisite commits required. Patch applies cleanly
(`git apply --check` succeeded). Uses only existing `slave->status` enum
values and control flow.

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

### Step 4.1: Original discussion
**Record:**
- **URL:** https://patch.msgid.link/20260520025720.1999367-1-yung-
  chuan.liao@linux.intel.com
- **Series:** v1 only (standalone patch)
- **Key feedback:**
  - Pierre-Louis Bossart initially questioned the scenario.
  - Bard Liao replied: race during suspend/resume testing;
    `sdw_handle_slave_alerts()` called while peripheral still
    unattached.
  - Bossart: incomplete but not wrong; gave `Reviewed-by`.
  - Vinod Koul applied to mainline.
- **Stable nomination:** none found in thread.

### Step 4.2: Reviewers
**Record:** CC'd linux-sound, vkoul@kernel.org, Pierre-Louis Bossart,
Péter Ujfalusi. Appropriate subsystem coverage.

### Step 4.3: Bug report
**Record:** No syzbot/bugzilla report. Bug evidence is author's
suspend/resume test observation and maintainer acknowledgment of a
plausible race.

### Step 4.4: Related patches
**Record:** Same author recently fixed similar "don't touch unattached
peripheral" issues; those are already in 6.18.y.

### Step 4.5: Stable list
**Record:** No stable-list discussion found for this specific patch.

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

### Step 5.1: Key functions
**Record:** `sdw_handle_slave_status()`, `sdw_handle_slave_alerts()`,
`sdw_modify_slave_status()`, `sdw_update_slave_status()`.

### Step 5.2: Callers
**Record:** `sdw_handle_slave_status()` called from:
- `drivers/soundwire/cadence_master.c` (Intel Cadence manager, IRQ path)
- `drivers/soundwire/amd_manager.c` (AMD, workqueue)
- `drivers/soundwire/qcom.c` (Qualcomm)

All are hot paths for bus state changes and interrupts.

### Step 5.3: Callees
**Record:** `sdw_handle_slave_alerts()` does runtime PM, register
reads/writes, optional driver `interrupt_callback`, and status
modification — all inappropriate on an unattached peripheral.

### Step 5.4: Reachability
**Record:** Reachable from hardware interrupts and suspend/resume
status-update work on systems with `CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE`. This is a real
device operation path, not init-only dead code.

### Step 5.5: Similar patterns
**Record:** Identical `slave->status != SDW_SLAVE_ATTACHED &&
slave->status != SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` guard already exists in clock-stop
helpers in the same file. This patch closes a gap in alert handling.

---

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCE WITH LOCAL TREE

### Step 6.1: Buggy code present?
**Record:** Yes. Current `drivers/soundwire/bus.c` at lines 1960–1966
handles `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` without any `slave->status` check. Bug present
since 2017 (`b0a9c37b0178b`).

### Step 6.2: Backport complications
**Record:** Clean apply expected and verified. No structural divergence
in the target hunk.

### Step 6.3: Related fixes already present?
**Record:** Related unattached-peripheral guard (`d3896c944338c`) is
already in this tree. This specific alert-path guard is not.

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

### Step 7.1: Subsystem criticality
**Record:** `drivers/soundwire/` — **IMPORTANT** (common on modern
Intel/AMD laptop audio paths; not core-kernel-wide, but affects many
consumer devices).

### Step 7.2: Activity
**Record:** Actively maintained; multiple recent bus.c changes in
6.18.y.

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK

### Step 8.1: Who is affected
**Record:** Users with SoundWire audio (Intel/AMD/Qualcomm platforms),
especially during suspend/resume.

### Step 8.2: Trigger conditions
**Record:** Rare race during suspend/resume where hardware reports
`SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` before driver state reflects attachment. Not
userspace-triggerable directly, but system PM operations are universal
on laptops.

### Step 8.3: Failure mode severity
**Record:**
- Incorrect state transition (`UNATTACHED` → `ALERT`)
- Spurious register I/O and error logging
- Potential suspend/resume/audio instability
- **Severity: MEDIUM** (functional PM/audio issue, not demonstrated
  kernel panic or memory corruption)

### Step 8.4: Risk-benefit
**Record:**
- **Benefit:** Prevents incorrect alert processing during PM
  transitions; aligns with existing defensive patterns; author hit it in
  testing.
- **Risk:** Very low (4 lines, same pattern as existing code).
- **Ratio:** Favorable for stable.

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

### Step 9.1: Evidence summary

**FOR backport:**
- Real bug observed during suspend/resume testing (author)
- Prevents nonsensical I/O and status corruption on unattached
  peripherals
- Tiny, obviously correct, matches existing in-tree pattern
- Applies cleanly to 6.18.44
- Reviewed by subsystem maintainer and Intel SoundWire developers
- Same class of fix already backported to this tree (`d3896c944338c`)

**AGAINST backport:**
- Bug is rare
- Maintainer noted fix may be incomplete for all race scenarios
- No crash/oops/data-corruption report attached
- No explicit stable nomination

**Unresolved:**
- Exact failure symptoms beyond spurious alert handling not fully
  documented (no stack trace in thread)

### Step 9.2: Stable rules checklist
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — logic is sound;
   suspend/resume testing cited; three Reviewed-by.
2. Fixes a real bug affecting users? **PASS** — suspend/resume race on
   SoundWire hardware.
3. Important issue? **PASS** — PM/audio stability on laptop hardware
   (MEDIUM severity).
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — 4 lines, one file.
5. No new features/APIs? **PASS**.
6. Can apply to local tree? **PASS** — verified clean apply.

### Step 9.3: Exception categories
**Record:** None (not device ID/quirk/DT/build/docs). This is a straight
bug fix.

### Step 9.4: Decision rationale
This commit closes a real gap in SoundWire bus status handling that can
cause spurious alert processing during suspend/resume races. The fix is
minimal, follows an established pattern already present in the same file
and tree, applies cleanly to 6.18.y, and addresses a user-visible
PM/audio issue. While rare and possibly incomplete for all races, it is
clearly correct defensive code with low regression risk — appropriate
for stable.

## Verification

- [Phase 1] Parsed subject, tags, body; no Fixes/Reported-by/syzbot
- [Phase 1] Mailing-list follow-up confirms suspend/resume race (`b4 dig
  -m /tmp/sdw_alert.mbox`)
- [Phase 2] Diff: +4 lines in `sdw_handle_slave_status()`
  `SDW_SLAVE_ALERT` case
- [Phase 2] Read `sdw_handle_slave_alerts()`: performs status change,
  PM, register I/O
- [Phase 3] `git blame`: alert case from `b0a9c37b0178b` (2017), present
  in tree
- [Phase 3] `git merge-base --is-ancestor 38cd651ebce70 HEAD` → exit 1
  (commit NOT in tree)
- [Phase 3] `git merge-base --is-ancestor b0a9c37b0178b HEAD` → exit 0
  (buggy code in tree)
- [Phase 3] Related fix `d3896c944338c` already in tree
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c 38cd651ebce70`: lore URL found
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -a`: single v1 patch
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -w`: vkoul, linux-sound, Bossart CC'd
- [Phase 4] Mbox: Bossart questioned, author cited suspend/resume race,
  Bossart Reviewed-by
- [Phase 5] `grep sdw_handle_slave_status`: callers in cadence_master.c,
  amd_manager.c, qcom.c
- [Phase 5] `grep slave->status != SDW_SLAVE_ATTACHED`: same guard
  pattern at lines 1074+, 1129+, 1200+, 1242+
- [Phase 6] `git describe HEAD` → v6.18.44
- [Phase 6] `make -s kernelversion` → 6.18.44
- [Phase 6] Read current bus.c lines 1960–1966: missing guard confirmed
- [Phase 6] `git show 38cd651ebce70 -p | git apply --check` → clean
  apply
- [Phase 8] Failure mode assessed as MEDIUM PM/audio correctness issue
  from code analysis

**YES**The background searches finished and match what the analysis
already used:

- **Git history search** (`--grep "only handle alert events"`): no hit
  on the current `stable/linux-6.18.y` checkout — the fix is not in this
  tree yet.
- **Master search**: found upstream commit `38cd651ebce70` on `master`
  (merged via `soundwire-7.2-rc1`).

**Verdict for v6.18.44:** **YES** — small suspend/resume race guard,
applies cleanly, same pattern as other unattached-peripheral fixes
already in this tree.
