6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Bernard Pidoux <bernard.f6bvp@gmail.com>

ax25_rcv() creates a connection on an incoming SABM, for a listening
socket or for a callsign registered by ROSE or NET/ROM. Like the ones
made by ax25_send_frame(), it holds no reference on the ax25_dev and
relies on ax25_kill_by_device() to detach it before the ax25_dev is
freed. If it is added to ax25_list after ax25_kill_by_device() has
walked the list, it is left pointing to a freed ax25_dev.

ax25_rcv() is called from the packet type handler, under
rcu_read_lock(), and ax25_kill_by_device() now clears device_up and
waits for the RCU readers before its walk. Drop the frame when
device_up is clear: a frame that gets past the test is fully processed
before the walk starts, and none is processed behind it.

The window is much smaller than for ax25_send_frame(): the core already
drops what is received on a device that is no longer running, so only a
frame that was queued before the device was stopped and is processed
late can hit it. I could not exercise it. The change was checked for
regressions only: incoming connections still work in the ROSE tests of
the previous patch, where every AX.25 link is opened by an incoming
SABM on one side.
