I agree broadly with the concept of having flags that define _behaviours_ rather
than nebulous traits from which behaviour is derived.

I think _ideally_ it'd be good to move away from saying 'special' and just being
as specific as we can about it.

Yes agreed.

I think there's a great deal of confusion and weird overlap between these
'special' flags, and I think sometimes people set one of them arbitrarily to
_get the behaviours_ they want.

And really people set these flags to get certain behaviour, so just have the
flag say what behaviour is wanted.

I think often VM_IO too.

The vagueness of these flags is unhelpful, and the overloading of 'special' is
in mm is hideous - 'special' isn't special because there's about 3 different
definitions of it ;)

We can fix that by having explicit helpers that does VM_SPECIAL's job for it
like vma_can_merge(), vma_can_mlock(), vma_can_split(), vma_can_remap(),
vma_can_uffd() etc.

Ack will do! That's an annoying/confusing inconsistency.

Yeah I can take care of all of this given it forms part of my VMA flags ->
bitmap series(es) anyway.

Again though I'd rather we find a way to be as explicit as we can be, the
'special' overloading is a bit horrid.

Or settle on one meaning of special that we define somewhere :)

This is where the helper struct work comes in handy for the merge logic, as you
can have a vmg_can_merge() helper which achieves the same thing even when you
don't have the VMA yet.

Agreed.

Will put a series together!
