6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Jamal Hadi Salim <jhs@mojatatu.com>

[ Upstream commit 98b34f3e8c3492cfc89ff943c9d92b4d52863d1d ]

Add a 2-bit per-skb tc depth field to track packet loops across the stack.

The previous per-CPU loop counters like MIRRED_NEST_LIMIT
assume a single call stack and lose state in two cases:
1) When a packet is queued and reprocessed later (e.g., egress->ingress
   via backlog), the per-cpu state is gone by the time it is dequeued.
2) With XPS/RPS a packet may arrive on one CPU and be processed on
   another.

A per-skb field solves both by travelling with the packet itself.

The field fits in existing padding, using 2 bits that were previously a
hole:

pahole before(-) and after (+) diff looks like:
   __u8       slow_gro:1;           /*   132: 3  1 */
   __u8       csum_not_inet:1;      /*   132: 4  1 */
   __u8       unreadable:1;         /*   132: 5  1 */
 + __u8       tc_depth:2;           /*   132: 6  1 */

 - /* XXX 2 bits hole, try to pack */
   /* XXX 1 byte hole, try to pack */

   __u16      tc_index;             /*   134     2 */

There used to be a ttl field which was removed as part of tc_verd in commit
aec745e2c520 ("net-tc: remove unused tc_verd fields").  It was already
unused by that time, due to remove earlier in commit c19ae86a510c ("tc: remove
unused redirect ttl").

The first user of this field is netem, which increments tc_depth on
duplicated packets before re-enqueueing them at the root qdisc.  On
re-entry, netem skips duplication for any skb with tc_depth already set,
bounding recursion to a single level regardless of tree topology.

The other user is mirred which increments it on each pass
and limits to depth to MIRRED_DEFER_LIMIT (3).

The new field was called ttl in earlier versions of this patch
but renamed to tc_depth to avoid confusion with IP ttl.

Note (looking at you Sashiko! Dont ignore me and continue bringing this up):
1. Since both mirred and netem utilize the same 2-bit tc_depth field it is
   possible when netem and mirred are used together that netem qdisc to skip
   the duplication step. This is a known trade-off, as a 2-bit field cannot
   independently track both features' recursion depths and it is not considered
   sane to have a setup that addresses both features on at the same time.

2. skb_scrub_packet does not clear tc_depth. This means a packet's loop history
  is preserved even across namespaces. While this might be restrictive for
  some topologies, it is also design intent to provide robustness against loops
  across namespaces.
