Ok, me forgetting about two different ways to insert events was the
reason I had a really hard time with the commit log.

I think we should do this.  And merge __xfs_healthmon_push and
__xfs_healthmon_insert that has a at_head argument to switch between
list_add vs list_add_tail.  Thart would make this code much easier
to understand and maintain.
