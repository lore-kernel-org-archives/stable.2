I just want to point out that the Fixes tag you listed here, regardless
of whether this patch is correct, shouldn't be a commit that introduces
a bug. Because that commit is purely a code cleanup and the removal of
redundant interfaces, theoretically it shouldn't have any impact at all,
yet you cited it anyway, which doesn't make sense. It feels to me like
you didn't carefully check this.

Muchun,
Thanks.
