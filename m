6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Bernard Pidoux <bernard.f6bvp@gmail.com>

ax25_kick() keeps every I frame on the ack queue until it is
acknowledged and hands a clone of it to the device. After a REJ or a T1
timeout the frame goes back to the write queue and ax25_kick() clones it
again. A clone shares its data with the original, so ax25_send_iframe()
and ax25_transmit_buffer() write the control field and the address
header of the new clone in the very bytes used by the previous one. If
the previous clone is still waiting in the device queue, its control
field is rewritten there: it leaves with the N(R) current at the time
of the retransmission, not the one it was sent with.

Frames queued behind it, an RR for instance, were built in between with
a lower N(R). The peer then receives an N(R) lower than one it has
already been given. ax25_validate_nr() rejects it and
ax25_std_nr_error_recovery() resets the link with a SABM, in the middle
of a transfer. The layers above pay for it: on a ROSE circuit, the
frames replayed after the reset carry stale sequence numbers and the
circuit is reset as well, with loss of data.

Hand a private copy to the device instead. The frames are small (256
bytes of data by default) and the link is slow, the extra copy is not
measurable.

Found on a test bench: two virtual machines with four CPUs each, a
6.12.94 kernel with KASAN and lockdep, one ROSE circuit over an AX.25
link on a serial line (mkiss), 192 messages each way in bursts of 24,
and three REJ frames injected by one side. Instrumentation showed that
frames reached the driver in the order they were given to
dev_queue_xmit(), that V(R) never went backwards on the sender, and
that the driver nevertheless saw frames whose N(R) was lower than the
one before.

Counting, on the receiver, the frames whose N(R) is lower than the
previous one:

 - this code plus the two pending AX.25 fixes used on the bench (REJ
   guard, requeue on re-establishment): 4 runs, 13 such frames, 4 link
   resets; with this patch: 6 runs, none, no link reset;
 - the same with the transmit serialisation patches for AX.25 and ROSE
   on top: link resets in most runs before; with this patch: 6 runs,
   none, no link reset, no ROSE reset, 192/192 messages both ways in
   every run.
