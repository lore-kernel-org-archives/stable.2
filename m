5.15-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Stephen Dolan <sdolan@janestreet.com>

This is a stable-specific fix. There is no single upstream commit to
cherry-pick; the equivalent mainline fix is commit 83b0177a6c48
("x86/mm: Fix SMP ordering in switch_mm_irqs_off()"), which is in
v6.18 but does not apply to these trees because the surrounding code
was refactored.

The backports of commit fea4e317f9e7 ("x86/mm: Eliminate window where
TLB flushes may be inadvertently skipped") -- the fix for
CVE-2025-37964 -- to the 6.1, 6.6 and 6.12 trees ended up with two
code blocks in the wrong order relative to mainline. The fix depends
on setting cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm to LOADED_MM_SWITCHING *before*
reading tlb_gen, so that a concurrent TLB shootdown either sees
LOADED_MM_SWITCHING and sends the IPI, or the switching CPU sees the
updated tlb_gen. In the stable trees the write of LOADED_MM_SWITCHING
was placed after the tlb_gen read, so the race window fea4e317f9e7 was
meant to close is still open and CVE-2025-37964 is unfixed there:
a process can be left running with stale TLB entries, which typically
manifests as rare, hard-to-bisect memory corruption or segfaults.

This has been confirmed by several independent parties:

  - reproduced on 6.1.y/6.6.y/6.12.y with the test program in [1],
    and confirmed fixed by this patch
  - Seth Forshee saw segfaults on 6.12.y within ~30 minutes of running
    a test workload; with this patch it ran 18 hours cleanly [2]
  - Greg Thelen reports 6.6.y- and 6.12.y-based test failures fixed by
    this patch [3]

Dave Hansen acked the patch [4] and has no objection to it going into
stable [5].

The patch below is against 6.12.y; the identical change applies to
6.1.y and 6.6.y. (The cpumask_test_cpu()/smp_mb() portion of the
mainline fix is not needed here because commit 209954cbc7d0
("x86/mm/tlb: Update mm_cpumask lazily") was never backported to these
trees.)

[Lee: The v5.15.y backport of fea4e317f9e7 (12f703811af0) placed the
      LOADED_MM_SWITCHING write after the tlb_gen read too, so v5.15.y
      suffers from the same issue.  Applies cleanly]
