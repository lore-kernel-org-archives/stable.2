I spent a while trying to figure out how I went wrong in selecting the
function name:

 * capable - Determine if the current task has a superior capability in effect
 * @cap: The capability to be tested for
 *
 * Return true if the current task has the given superior capability currently
 * available for use, false if not.

vs.

 * has_capability_noaudit - Does a task have a capability (unaudited) in the
 * initial user ns
 * @t: The task in question
 * @cap: The capability to be tested for
 *
 * Return true if the specified task has the given superior capability
 * currently in effect to init_user_ns, false if not.  Don't write an
 * audit message for the check.

vs.

 * ns_capable_noaudit - Determine if the current task has a superior capability
 * (unaudited) in effect
 * @ns:  The usernamespace we want the capability in
 * @cap: The capability to be tested for
 *
 * Return true if the current task has the given superior capability currently
 * available for use, false if not.

All three of these sound the same to me.  But what about the call path?

capable -> ns_capable -> ns_capable_common

has_capability_noaudit -> has_ns_capability_noaudit

ns_capable_noaudit -> ns_capable_common

Hum, maybe that's the difference -- ns_capable_common vs.
has_ns_capability_noaudit?

ns_capable_common calls security_capable() with current_cred(), whereas
has_ns_capability_noaudit calls it with __task_cred(t), which is
@current in the xfs_trans_alloc_ichange case.

Aha!  current_cred is current->cred, whereas __task_cred(current) is
current->real_cred, and these aren't the same thing:

	/* Objective and real subjective task credentials (COW): */
	const struct cred __rcu		*real_cred;

	/* Effective (overridable) subjective task credentials (COW): */
	const struct cred __rcu		*cred;

So I guess ns_capable_common (and wrappers) are testing the process'
effective credentials, whereas has_ns_capability_noaudit is testing the
process' real credentials?

It would have been *really* nice if the documentation for those
functions mentioned that distinction!

So yeah, I agree we should change that to:

	ns_capable_noaudit(&init_user_ns, CAP_FOWNER)

Though it's also weird that XFS gates it on CAP_FOWNER whereas the VFS
checks CAP_SYS_RESOURCE.  Though I would have added this:

static inline bool
current_may_ignore_quota_limits(void)
{
	/*
	 * If the current process' effective credentials include
	 * CAP_FOWNER, then they're allowed to ignore the hard limit.
	 */
	return ns_capable_noaudit(&init_user_ns, CAP_FOWNER);
}

and then changed the callsites in xfs_ioctl/xfs_iops.c to:

	error = xfs_trans_alloc_ichange(ip, udqp, gdqp, NULL,
			current_may_ignore_quota_limits(), &tp);

The has_capability_noaudit call in xfs_fsmap.c should change to
ns_capable_noaudit.

--D
