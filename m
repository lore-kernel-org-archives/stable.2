Let me try again:

"LOLLM complains that while __xfs_healthmon_insert is supposed to insert
an event at the head of the list, it doesn't do that correctly if the
list isn't empty.  In that case it *should* make our new event point to
the current head, and then make the head point to the new event, but
it doesn't actually update the head."

The only event that gets inserted at the front is the unmount event.
This signals that the filesystem is being completely unmounted (not just
detached from a mount ns) and there's nothing further that xfs_healer
can do to fix the filesystem.  Therefore we put the unmount item first
in the list so that xfs_healer won't waste time trying to find the
mount to do repairs that it won't be able to make.

xfs_healthmon_push will set first_event if the list is empty.

(for context, all other events are _pushed on to the end of the list)

Yes, that at least wouldn't increase the size of xfs_healthmon_event.
