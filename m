net/smc: reject CDC messages after connection teardown

This patch adds a conn->freed check in smc_cdc_msg_recv() after
bh_lock_sock(). The goal is to discard CDC messages that passed the
connection lookup before close(2) tore the connection down. That avoids a
use-after-free of a registration-failed RMB descriptor released by
smc_conn_free().

[Severity: High]
Does this check serialize against smc_conn_free()?

bh_lock_sock() only takes sk->sk_lock.slock. The close path calls
smc_conn_free() while it owns the socket through lock_sock().
lock_sock_nested() sets sk_lock.owned and then drops slock, or it takes
the cmpxchg fast path. Either way, the owner does not hold slock while
smc_conn_free() runs, and smc_conn_free() never takes slock itself.

The sock_owned_by_user() branch already in smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() also
shows that this tasklet is expected to run while a process owns the socket.

On SMC-R, could this sequence still happen?

CPU0 (smc_wr_rx tasklet)
smc_cdc_rx_handler()
  smc_lgr_find_conn()
  read_unlock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock)
  smc_cdc_msg_recv()
    bh_lock_sock()          /* slock is free */
    if (!smc->conn.freed)   /* sees 0 */
      smc_cdc_msg_recv_action()

CPU1 (close, owns the socket via lock_sock())
smc_release()->__smc_release()->smc_conn_free()
  conn->freed = 1;
  smc_cdc_wait_pend_tx_wr()        /* only waits for TX */
  cancel_work_sync(&conn->abort_work)
  smc_buf_unuse()->smcr_buf_unuse()->smc_buf_free()
    /* is_reg_err rmb_desc is kfree()d */

CPU0
smc_cdc_msg_recv_action()
  smc_curs_diff(conn->rmb_desc->len, ...)

That last read is the same one shown in the KASAN report. If urgent data is
present, smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival() also reads
conn->rmb_desc->cpu_addr.

smc_lgr_unregister_conn() takes write_lock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock). However,
it runs after smc_buf_unuse() and only waits for the lookup section. The
tasklet's sock_hold() keeps the smc_sock alive, but it does not protect
rmb_desc.

On SMC-D, tasklet_kill(&conn->rx_tsklet) in smc_conn_free() drains RX
processing. There does not seem to be an equivalent on SMC-R.

conn->freed is also written and read without a shared lock, and without
READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE().

The commit message says:

    Both smc_conn_free() and CDC message processing run under the socket lock.

Is that accurate, given that the two sides use different parts of the
socket lock?

One option is for smc_conn_free() on SMC-R to set conn->freed under
bh_lock_sock() / spin_lock_bh(&sk->sk_lock.slock) before it releases any
buffers. A tasklet that already saw freed == 0 would then finish first.
Another option is to wait for in-flight RX processing before rmb_desc is
freed. Would either of these work?

>  	sock_put(&smc->sk); /* no free sk in softirq-context */

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch.
smc_cdc_rx_handler() has a second path after the lookup that the new check
does not cover:

net/smc/smc_cdc.c:smc_cdc_rx_handler() {
    ...
	sock_hold(&smc->sk);
	read_unlock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock);

	if (cdc->prod_flags.failover_validation) {
		smc_cdc_msg_validate(smc, cdc, link);
		goto out;
	}
    ...
}

smc_cdc_msg_validate() runs without the socket lock and without a
conn->freed check. If the seqno sent by the peer makes diff < 0, it does
this:

	conn->lnk = link;
	spin_unlock_bh(&conn->send_lock);
	sock_hold(&smc->sk); /* sock_put in abort_work */
	if (!queue_work(smc_close_wq, &conn->abort_work))

Suppose the lookup lands while smc_conn_free() is inside smc_buf_unuse().
That is after cancel_work_sync(&conn->abort_work) and before
smc_lgr_unregister_conn(), and smc_buf_unuse() can sleep in the LLC
delete-rkey flow. Can abort_work then be queued after it was already
cancelled?

If so, smc_conn_abort_work()->smc_conn_kill() reads conn->lgr->is_smcd with
no freed check. By then smc_conn_free() has dropped the connection's lgr
and link references through smc_lgr_put() and smcr_link_put(), and
conn->lgr is never cleared. Could this be a use-after-free of the link
group if the link group is torn down at the same time?

The conn->lnk = link assignment also takes no reference with
smcr_link_hold(). Could it race with smcr_link_put(conn->lnk) in
smc_conn_free() and drop the reference on the wrong link?

The commit message says "Discard messages which passed the lookup before
teardown", but only the smc_cdc_msg_recv() path does that.

[Severity: Medium]
This is also a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch.
smc_conn_free() ignores the return value of cancel_work_sync():

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_free() {
    ...
		smc_cdc_wait_pend_tx_wr(conn);
		if (current_work() != &conn->abort_work)
			cancel_work_sync(&conn->abort_work);
    ...
}

smc_cdc_msg_validate() calls sock_hold() before it queues abort_work. The
only matching sock_put() is in smc_conn_abort_work():

	sock_put(&smc->sk); /* sock_hold done by schedulers of abort_work */

If abort_work is still pending when smc_conn_free() cancels it, the callback
never runs. Does that leak the smc_sock reference taken in
smc_cdc_msg_validate(), so the socket is never freed?
