I think that using RANGE_INV / range_inv would be more consistent with
the existing code, but IDR3_RIL should remain as-is because it maps
directly to the spec.

If we can do that without churning the driver (looks like we can), then
it's probably worth it, but I wouldn't be keen on churning existing code
for things like this.
