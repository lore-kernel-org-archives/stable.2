[ Upstream commit e765ab012f73717238c95ab9c34bfc3c767fa48c ]

A short transfer is a successful one, so reset the error count.
Otherwise, endpoints which always complete short are limited to
three retries per endpoint life rather than per URB.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit Message Forensics

**Step 1.1 – Subject line**

Record: `[usb: xhci]` `[Improve]` – Improve soft-retry error counting
after short bulk/interrupt transfers.

**Step 1.2 – Tags**

Record:
- `Signed-off-by: Michal Pecio <michal.pecio@gmail.com>` (author)
- `Signed-off-by: Mathias Nyman <mathias.nyman@linux.intel.com>` (xHCI
  maintainer)
- `Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>` (USB
  maintainer)
- `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260603091132.1110849-7-
  mathias.nyman@linux.intel.com` (patch 7/7 in a series)
- No `Fixes:`, `Reported-by:`, `Cc: stable`, `Tested-by:`, or `Reviewed-
  by:` tags

**Step 1.3 – Body analysis**

Record:
- **Bug:** `ep->err_count` is not cleared on `COMP_SHORT_PACKET`, even
  though a short transfer is a successful completion.
- **Symptom:** Endpoints that routinely complete short are limited to
  three soft retries over the endpoint’s lifetime, not per URB/transfer.
- **Root cause:** `err_count` is reset on `COMP_SUCCESS` but not on
  `COMP_SHORT_PACKET`, so successful short transfers do not reset the
  counter.
- **Version info:** None in the message.

**Step 1.4 – Hidden bug fix?**

Record: **Yes.** Although the subject says “Improve,” this is a
correctness bug in xHCI soft-retry error accounting, not a cosmetic
cleanup.

---

## Phase 2: Diff Analysis

**Step 2.1 – Inventory**

Record:
- **Files:** `drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c` (+1 line)
- **Function:** `process_bulk_intr_td()`
- **Scope:** Single-file, one-line surgical fix

**Step 2.2 – Code flow change**

Record:
- **Before:** `COMP_SHORT_PACKET` sets `td->status = 0` only;
  `ep->err_count` is unchanged.
- **After:** `COMP_SHORT_PACKET` also sets `ep->err_count = 0`, matching
  `COMP_SUCCESS`.
- **Path:** Bulk/interrupt transfer completion in
  `process_bulk_intr_td()`, called from `handle_tx_event()` for non-
  control, non-isoc endpoints.

**Step 2.3 – Bug mechanism**

Record: **Logic / error-recovery bug.** `MAX_SOFT_RETRY` is 3. On
`COMP_USB_TRANSACTION_ERROR`, `ep->err_count` is incremented; if it
exceeds 3, soft retry is skipped and the error path proceeds without
`xhci_handle_halted_endpoint(..., EP_SOFT_RESET)`. Successful
completions should reset the counter, but short completions did not.

**Step 2.4 – Fix quality**

Record:
- **Obviously correct:** Short packet is a successful transfer
  (`td->status = 0`); resetting `err_count` matches `COMP_SUCCESS` and
  the design intent.
- **Minimal:** One line.
- **Regression risk:** Very low; only resets a counter on a success
  path.

---

## Phase 3: Git History Investigation

**Step 3.1 – Blame**

Record:
- Soft retry introduced in `f8f80be501aa2` (2018): `ep_ring->err_count =
  0` on `COMP_SUCCESS`.
- `err_count` moved to endpoint in `a1575120972ec` (Nov 2022, backported
  with `Cc: stable`).
- `COMP_SHORT_PACKET` handling dates to 2017; never reset `err_count`.
- Bug present since soft-retry accounting was added (~2018).

**Step 3.2 – Fixes: tag**

Record: N/A – no `Fixes:` tag.

**Step 3.3 – Related file history**

Record:
- Related short-packet work by Michal Pecio: `9e3a28793d2fd` (“Fix Short
  Packet handling rework ignoring errors”), affecting UAC, UVC, serial,
  UAS.
- This fix is standalone; no dependency on other series patches for
  correctness.

**Step 3.4 – Author context**

Record: Michal Pecio is an active xHCI contributor; Mathias Nyman is the
xHCI maintainer. Both signed off.

**Step 3.5 – Dependencies**

Record: **Standalone.** One-line addition; no new symbols or structures.
Patch 7/7 in submission, but this hunk is self-contained.

---

## Phase 4: Mailing List and External Research

**Step 4.1 – Original discussion**

Record: Link points to patch 7/7 in a Mathias Nyman series (2026-06-03).
`b4 dig` did not find the committed hash (commit not in this tree).
`patch.msgid.link` and `lore.kernel.org` were blocked (403/Anubis).
Discussion content could not be fetched.

**Step 4.2 – Reviewers**

Record: UNVERIFIED from lore. Commit has SOBs from author, xHCI
maintainer, and USB maintainer.

**Step 4.3 – Bug report**

Record: No external bug report or syzbot link. Bug inferred from code
analysis and commit message.

**Step 4.4 – Series context**

Record: Patch 7/7; this change does not appear to require earlier series
patches.

**Step 4.5 – Stable list**

Record: UNVERIFIED – could not search lore stable archives due to access
restrictions.

---

## Phase 5: Code Semantic Analysis

**Step 5.1 – Key functions**

Record: `process_bulk_intr_td()`, caller `handle_tx_event()`.

**Step 5.2 – Callers**

Record: `handle_tx_event()` is the main xHCI transfer-event handler,
invoked from the xhci interrupt path for every bulk/interrupt transfer
completion. High-traffic, common path.

**Step 5.3 – Callees**

Record: On transaction error with `err_count <= MAX_SOFT_RETRY`, calls
`xhci_handle_halted_endpoint(..., EP_SOFT_RESET)`. When limit exceeded,
soft retry is skipped and `finish_td()` runs with `-EPROTO`.

**Step 5.4 – Reachability**

Record: **Highly reachable.** Any bulk/interrupt endpoint can hit this.
Critically, in `handle_tx_event()`:

```2707:2712:drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c
        case COMP_SUCCESS:
                if (EVENT_TRB_LEN(le32_to_cpu(event->transfer_len)) !=
0) {
                        trb_comp_code = COMP_SHORT_PACKET;
                        xhci_dbg(xhci, "Successful completion on short
TX for slot %u ep %u with last td comp code %d\n",
                                 slot_id, ep_index,
ep_ring->old_trb_comp_code);
                }
```

Short transfers reported as `COMP_SUCCESS` are converted to
`COMP_SHORT_PACKET` before `process_bulk_intr_td()` runs. So the
`COMP_SUCCESS` `err_count` reset does **not** apply to short transfers
on typical hosts; they go through `COMP_SHORT_PACKET` without resetting
the counter.

**Step 5.5 – Similar patterns**

Record: `ep->err_count = 0` exists only on `COMP_SUCCESS` in
`process_bulk_intr_td()`. `handle_transferless_tx_event()` increments
`err_count` on stream transaction errors but never resets it on success.
This fix addresses the bulk/intr path only.

---

## Phase 6: Cross-Reference Against Local Tree

**Step 6.1 – Buggy code in this tree?**

Record: **Yes.** Local tree is **v6.18.44** (`git describe HEAD`, `make
kernelversion`). At lines 2572–2574, `COMP_SHORT_PACKET` does not reset
`ep->err_count`. The candidate commit is not yet applied.

**Step 6.2 – Backport complications**

Record: **Clean apply expected** – single line in a stable function with
no recent churn at that hunk.

**Step 6.3 – Related fixes already present?**

Record: `git log --grep='Soft Retries'` returned nothing. No equivalent
fix in this tree.

---

## Phase 7: Subsystem and Maintainer Context

**Step 7.1 – Subsystem**

Record: `drivers/usb/host/` – USB xHCI host controller driver.
**Criticality: IMPORTANT** (core USB path for most modern systems).

**Step 7.2 – Activity**

Record: Active subsystem; recent xhci fixes include HCE interrupt storm,
memory leaks, and short-packet handling.

---

## Phase 8: Impact and Risk Assessment

**Step 8.1 – Who is affected**

Record: Users of xHCI with bulk/interrupt endpoints that complete short
(serial, UVC, UAC, storage status pipes, interrupt IN with fixed
buffers). Essentially all xHCI users with typical USB devices.

**Step 8.2 – Trigger conditions**

Record:
- Endpoint sees successful short transfers (very common).
- Plus occasional `COMP_USB_TRANSACTION_ERROR` (transient bus errors).
- After 3 such errors, `err_count` stays elevated because short
  successes never reset it.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate for long-lived endpoints with occasional bus
  noise.

**Step 8.3 – Failure mode severity**

Record:
- Soft retry stops after 3 transaction errors over endpoint lifetime.
- Subsequent errors skip `EP_SOFT_RESET` and proceed to error completion
  / harder recovery.
- **Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH** – device malfunction, transfer failures,
  possible disconnect; not a kernel oops, but real user-visible USB
  breakage.

**Step 8.4 – Risk vs benefit**

Record:
- **Benefit:** HIGH for affected endpoints – restores intended per-
  transfer error accounting.
- **Risk:** VERY LOW – one line, mirrors existing `COMP_SUCCESS`
  behavior.
- **Ratio:** Strong benefit, minimal risk.

---

## Phase 9: Final Synthesis

**Step 9.1 – Evidence**

**FOR:**
- Real, long-standing logic bug in soft-retry accounting
- Affects a very common path (short bulk/interrupt transfers)
- `handle_tx_event()` converts success-with-remaining to
  `COMP_SHORT_PACKET`, so most short transfers hit the buggy path
- After 3 transaction errors, error recovery degrades permanently for
  that endpoint
- One-line, obviously correct fix
- Signed off by xHCI and USB maintainers
- Bug present in v6.18.44; fix applies cleanly

**AGAINST:**
- No syzbot report or user bug report in commit message
- Failure mode is degraded recovery, not kernel crash
- Lore discussion could not be verified

**UNRESOLVED:**
- Full mailing-list review thread inaccessible
- No explicit stable nomination found

**Step 9.2 – Stable rules checklist**

1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** – logic is clear; maintainer
   SOBs present; no runtime test cited.
2. Fixes a real bug affecting users? **PASS** – short transfers are
   routine; error accounting is wrong.
3. Important issue? **PASS (MEDIUM-HIGH)** – USB communication failures
   on common device classes.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** – 1 line, 1 file.
5. No new features or APIs? **PASS**.
6. Can apply to local tree? **PASS** – buggy code confirmed in v6.18.44.

**Step 9.3 – Exception categories**

Record: None (not device ID, quirk, DT, build, or docs). Standard bug
fix.

**Step 9.4 – Decision rationale**

This is a clear correctness bug in xHCI error recovery. Because
`handle_tx_event()` rewrites success-with-short-data to
`COMP_SHORT_PACKET`, the existing `err_count` reset on `COMP_SUCCESS`
does not cover the common short-transfer case. Endpoints that routinely
short-packet can exhaust their three soft retries permanently after only
three transient transaction errors, causing degraded USB error recovery.
The fix is minimal, obviously correct, and low risk.
