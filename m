Subject: [PATCH v3 11/24] sched/deadline: Do not take a waking task's bandwidth off a runqueue it left

A deadline task that wakes on another CPU has its bandwidth taken off
the runqueue it slept on by migrate_task_rq_dl(), from set_task_cpu(),
and charged to the one it wakes on by the enqueue that follows. That
enqueue can be left to the target CPU through the wake list, and
try_to_wake_up() returns before it runs: the task's task_cpu() is then
the CPU it wakes on while its bandwidth is on no runqueue at all.

Whatever happens to the task in that window takes its bandwidth from a
runqueue that does not have it, or gives it to one that already does:

 - sched_setattr() finds it off the runqueues, and
   dl_change_utilization() takes its old bandwidth off the runqueue of
   task_cpu(), which never held it. this_bw of that CPU underflows,
   which costs every other task and the fair server there their own, for
   good. switched_from_dl() leaves the class through the same hole;
 - a switch out of SCHED_DEADLINE and back in that window has
   switched_to_dl() charge the runqueue of task_cpu(), and the enqueue
   that lands later charges it a second time, since task_contending()
   goes by ENQUEUE_MIGRATED. this_bw of that CPU then counts the task
   twice, and the release of one of the two underflows it later.

Say in the entity whether a runqueue counts its bandwidth, as
dl_bw_oncpu, and have add_rq_bw() and sub_rq_bw() put it there and take
it away once each: an add on a runqueue that counts it already, and a
subtraction from one that does not, then change nothing, and
dl_change_utilization() has a runqueue to act on only while one counts
it. The servers keep their own tally, dl_bw_attached, and go through
__add_rq_bw() and __sub_rq_bw() directly.

Reaching the first needs a deadline task whose wakeup migrates, which
asks for more than one CPU in its root domain and for them to be taken.
It is easier to reach with CONFIG_SCHED_PROXY_EXEC=y, where a task
blocked on a mutex is migrated to the CPU of its owner and wakes back on
its own.

In 8 VMs of 8 vCPUs, a task of 10ms every 100ms that sleeps and wakes in
a partition root of two CPUs, both taken by deadline tasks of an earlier
deadline, its runtime changed between 10ms and 20ms from a CPU outside,
warns in all 8 within a second, and the warnings spread to the idle
task's accounting of both CPUs:

  WARNING: kernel/sched/deadline.c:352 at dl_rq_change_utilization+0x71/0x2e0, CPU#0: wake_race/109
   __sub_rq_bw(): this_bw underflow
  WARNING: kernel/sched/deadline.c:316 at task_contending+0x244/0x260, CPU#6: swapper/6/0
   __add_running_bw(): running_bw overflow

The 8 VMs above warn no more with this change. deadline_bw_test, added
later in this series, has params_waking for it: without this change it
fails on every one of those VMs, and random_mix on one of three.

The double charge of the second case was found by the Sashiko AI review
of the first posting of this series, which also pointed out that the
first version of this patch left its bit set for an entity with no
bandwidth of its own; a bit that says where the bandwidth is, rather
than where it is not, has neither fault.
