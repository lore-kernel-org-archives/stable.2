net/iucv: fix races in afiucv_netdev_event()

This reworks afiucv_netdev_event() into a two-pass algorithm: pass one walks
iucv_sk_list under read_lock_bh() and collects matching sockets with
sock_hold() into a local list, pass two takes lock_sock() per socket to send
the FIN and update sk_state.  It also converts the hs_dev clearing in
iucv_sock_close() to WRITE_ONCE() and the notifier read to READ_ONCE().

[Severity: Low]
Should the other lockless hs_dev accesses be marked as well?  Two of the
four sites that touch hs_dev without the socket lock are left as plain
accesses by this patch:

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:afiucv_hs_rcv() {
	read_lock(&iucv_sk_list.lock);
	sk_for_each(sk, &iucv_sk_list.head) {
		if (iucv_sk(sk)->hs_dev != dev)
			continue;
	...
}

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:afiucv_hs_callback_syn() {
	...
	niucv->hs_dev = iucv->hs_dev;
	dev_hold(niucv->hs_dev);
	...
}

With the plain read in afiucv_hs_rcv() still present, is the KCSAN report
the changelog says this suppresses (marked write in iucv_sock_close() versus
unmarked read) still reachable?  And the new READ_ONCE() in pass one is
paired against the unmarked store in afiucv_hs_callback_syn().

[Severity: Medium]
Is iucv_sock_close() really the only concurrent writer of hs_dev?
afiucv_hs_callback_syn() also writes it from softirq context:

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:afiucv_hs_callback_syn() {
	nsk = iucv_sock_alloc(NULL, sk->sk_protocol, GFP_ATOMIC, 0);
	bh_lock_sock(sk);
	...
	niucv->hs_dev = iucv->hs_dev;
	dev_hold(niucv->hs_dev);
	...
	nsk->sk_state = IUCV_CONNECTED;
}

iucv_sock_alloc() ends with iucv_sock_link(&iucv_sk_list, sk), so the child
is already visible in iucv_sk_list before hs_dev and sk_state are written,
and the only lock held here is the parent's bh_lock_sock().

That means read_lock_bh() in pass one does not exclude this writer, and
lock_sock(nsk) in pass two does not exclude the softirq that is still
finishing the child's setup.  Can the notifier then send a FIN on a child
socket in parallel with its SYN-ACK handling, or skip a child that turns
IUCV_CONNECTED on the device that is going down?

Could the comment be extended to cover this writer?

> +		read_lock_bh(&iucv_sk_list.lock);

[Severity: Medium]
What happens to a matching socket when this GFP_ATOMIC allocation fails?

The continue skips sock_hold() and the todo entry, so pass two never runs
for that socket: no FIN is sent through iucv_send_ctrl() on
NETDEV_GOING_DOWN, sk_state stays IUCV_CONNECTED with iucv->hs_dev still
pointing at the device going down, and sk_state_change() is never called.

Waiters depend on that transition:

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:iucv_sock_recvmsg() {
	if ((sk->sk_state == IUCV_DISCONN) &&
	    skb_queue_empty(&iucv->backlog_skb_q) && ...)
		return 0;
}

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:iucv_sock_poll() {
	if (sk->sk_state == IUCV_DISCONN)
		mask |= EPOLLIN;
}

There is no retry either, since the later notifications do nothing:

	case NETDEV_DOWN:
	case NETDEV_UNREGISTER:
	default:
		break;

The old loop needed no memory at all and could not skip a matching socket.
Could this be done without a per-socket allocation, for example sock_hold()
one socket, drop the list lock, act on it and restart the walk, or with a
list node embedded in struct iucv_sock?

The changelog describes the change purely as a race fix; should it mention
that a socket can now be skipped entirely under memory pressure?

> +			entry->sk = sk;

[Severity: Medium]
Does lock_sock() serialise against sock_orphan() here?

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:iucv_sock_release() {
	iucv_sock_close(sk);

	sock_orphan(sk);
	iucv_sock_kill(sk);
}

iucv_sock_close() takes and releases the socket lock internally, so
sock_orphan() runs with the socket lock not held, and sock_orphan() itself
uses a different lock:

include/net/sock.h:sock_orphan() {
	write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);
	sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD);
	sk_set_socket(sk, NULL);
	sk->sk_wq = NULL;
	write_unlock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);
}

The sk_socket claim matters because iucv_send_ctrl() ->
sock_alloc_send_pskb() dereferences sk->sk_socket->flags on the no-space
path.  Similarly, sk_state is written by the softirq callbacks under
bh_lock_sock() only, and there is no sock_owned_by_user() check anywhere in
this file.  Could the comment be narrowed to what lock_sock() actually
excludes?

> +		 * which requires non-atomic context -- satisfied here because
> +		 * we are no longer holding read_lock_bh.

> +		list_for_each_entry_safe(entry, tmp, &todo, list) {

> +			lock_sock(sk);

[Severity: High]
Can this stall the netdevice notifier chain while rtnl_lock is held?

afiucv_netdev_event() runs from the notifier chain with rtnl_lock held
(NETDEV_GOING_DOWN via __dev_close_many(), NETDEV_REBOOT via the reboot
notifier), and lock_sock() here waits for whoever currently owns the socket.

An AF_IUCV sender owns the socket lock across the whole send:

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:iucv_sock_sendmsg() {
	lock_sock(sk);
	...
	skb = sock_alloc_send_pskb(sk, headroom + linear, len - linear,
				   noblock, &err, 0);
	...
}

and the wait for send space does not drop that lock:

net/core/sock.c:sock_wait_for_wmem() {
	/* It is almost wait_for_tcp_memory minus release_sock/lock_sock. */
	...
	timeo = schedule_timeout(timeo);
	...
}

sk_sndtimeo starts at IUCV_CONN_TIMEOUT (40 * HZ) for AF_IUCV, and
setsockopt(SO_SNDTIMEO, {0,0}) makes it MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT:

net/core/sock.c:sock_set_timeout() {
	val = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
	if ((tv.tv_sec || tv.tv_usec) &&
	    (tv.tv_sec < (MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ - 1)))
		val = tv.tv_sec * HZ + ...;
}

The queued TX skbs that hold sk_wmem_alloc belong to the device being torn
down and are only purged by dev_deactivate_many(), which runs after the
notifier chain returns, so the shutdown itself does not release the waiter.

The pre-patch notifier never blocked on a socket lock.  Would a
bh_lock_sock() plus sock_owned_by_user() check, or deferring pass two to a
work item, avoid holding rtnl_lock across an unbounded socket-lock wait?

> +			if (sk->sk_state == IUCV_CONNECTED) {
>  				if (event == NETDEV_GOING_DOWN)
>  					iucv_send_ctrl(sk, AF_IUCV_FLAG_FIN);

[Severity: Medium]
Pass one no longer filters on sk_state, and pass two never re-checks hs_dev
against event_dev under the socket lock.  Can iucv->hs_dev be NULL by the
time iucv_send_ctrl() dereferences it?

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:iucv_send_ctrl() {
	blen = sizeof(struct af_iucv_trans_hdr) +
	       LL_RESERVED_SPACE(iucv->hs_dev);
	...
}

The dereference happens before afiucv_hs_send()'s later "if (!skb->dev)"
check can catch it.  A socket collected in IUCV_BOUND state (for example one
blocked in connect() waiting for the SYN-ACK) can reach pass two as
IUCV_CONNECTED with hs_dev already cleared:

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:iucv_sock_close() {
	default:
		iucv_sever_path(sk, 1);      /* IUCV_BOUND: state unchanged */
	}

	if (iucv->hs_dev) {
		dev_put(iucv->hs_dev);
		WRITE_ONCE(iucv->hs_dev, NULL);
	...
}

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:afiucv_hs_callback_synack() {
	if (!iucv || sk->sk_state != IUCV_BOUND) { ... }
	bh_lock_sock(sk);
	...
	sk->sk_state = IUCV_CONNECTED;
}

afiucv_hs_callback_synack() only tests sk_state, so it promotes the closed
but still IUCV_BOUND socket to IUCV_CONNECTED with hs_dev == NULL, and pass
two then calls iucv_send_ctrl() on it.  The same window also lets pass two
call sock_alloc_send_pskb() on an orphaned socket, which dereferences
sk->sk_socket->flags.

The changelog says "BUG-2: iucv_send_ctrl() is now called under lock_sock(),
not racing with concurrent socket close" - should pass two also re-validate
iucv->hs_dev == event_dev under the socket lock?

>  				sk->sk_state = IUCV_DISCONN;

[Severity: Medium]
The changelog states "BUG-3: sk_state is read and written under lock_sock(),
serialising against iucv_sock_close()".  Is that the full picture for
sk_state?

The softirq handlers in this file write sk_state with only bh_lock_sock():

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:afiucv_hs_callback_fin() {
	bh_lock_sock(sk);
	if (sk->sk_state == IUCV_CONNECTED) {
		sk->sk_state = IUCV_DISCONN;
	...
}

and the TX-completion path takes no socket lock at all:

net/iucv/af_iucv.c:afiucv_hs_callback_txnotify() {
	default:
		atomic_dec(&iucv->skbs_in_xmit);
		if (sk->sk_state == IUCV_CONNECTED) {
			sk->sk_state = IUCV_DISCONN;
	...
}

lock_sock() sets sk_lock.owned and then drops sk_lock.slock:

net/core/sock.c:lock_sock_nested() {
	spin_lock_bh(&sk->sk_lock.slock);
	...
	sk->sk_lock.owned = 1;
	spin_unlock_bh(&sk->sk_lock.slock);
}

so bh_lock_sock() users that never test sock_owned_by_user() are not
excluded, and grepping net/iucv/af_iucv.c for sock_owned_by_user() finds no
match.  Can the transition performed here be lost, or clobber a concurrent
softirq transition, while pass two sleeps inside iucv_send_ctrl() ->
sock_alloc_send_skb(GFP_KERNEL)?  Should the BUG-3 claim be scoped to
iucv_sock_close() only?
