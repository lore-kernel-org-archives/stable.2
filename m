6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Bernard Pidoux <bernard.f6bvp@gmail.com>

For a connect request rose_get_neigh() walks the routes that match the
address, from the most specific to the least specific, and takes the
first neighbour whose link is restarted. A neighbour whose link is down
is only used when no matching route at all has a restarted neighbour.

A node that has both an exact route to a neighbouring node and a wide
route through a relay therefore never uses the exact route once its
link is down: the relay is restarted, it is always found first, and
since no frame is ever sent over the direct link nothing brings it up
again. The calls keep going through the relay, which may have no route
other than back to the calling node and then clears them. Seen on a node
whose White Pages daemon calls an adjacent node: every call goes to the
relay and comes back as CLEAR REQUEST "not obtainable", for as long as
the node runs.

Keep sending the call to the restarted neighbour, so that a call never
waits for a link that may not answer, but when a neighbour of a more
specific route, or an earlier neighbour of the same route, was passed
over because its link is down, start the restart procedure on that link.
If the other end answers, the next call finds the link restarted and
uses it. A link that has just failed is left alone for
link_fail_timeout, and nothing is done while a restart is under way.

Frames in transit are handled as before.

Tested in QEMU with a lockdep and KASAN kernel, three nodes A - B - C
where B has an exact route to C over their direct link and a wide route
through A, and the link B - A is restarted while B - C is not. Before,
every call from B to C goes to A and is cleared there, and the direct
link stays down. After, the first call still goes to A, the direct link
is restarted within 20 ms and the following calls go through it. With C
switched off no call waits: they all go to A at once, the restart is
attempted once, and after the AX.25 connection gives up the link is left
alone for link_fail_timeout. A call from A to C in transit through B
gets the same answer before and after. No lockdep, KASAN or refcount
report.
