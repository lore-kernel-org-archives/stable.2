Subject: mm/damon/core: charge only the part of a region the filter left
Date: Mon, 21 Sep 2026 08:24:41 -0700

Patch series "mm/damon/core: fix the size charged for a filter-trimmed
region", v2.

An address range DAMOS filter that partially overlaps a monitoring region
splits it, so the scheme action reaches only one side of the boundary. 
damos_apply_scheme() reads the region size before that split and never
re-reads it, so the quota charge and schemes/<S>/stats/sz_tried account
for the whole original region.

Patch 1 re-reads the size after the core filters have run.  Patch 2 adds
KUnit coverage for what the function charges and reports, for the trimmed
cases and for the cases that must not change.


This patch (of 2):

An address range DAMOS filter that partially overlaps a monitoring region
splits the region at the filter boundary, so the scheme action is applied
to only one side of it.  damos_apply_scheme() reads the region size once
on entry, before damos_core_filter_out() performs that split.

The quota charge and the statistics update therefore account for the
region as it was before the trim.  schemes/<S>/stats/sz_tried counts
memory the filter excluded, which Documentation/mm/damon/design.rst says
is not counted as tried, and with quotas/bytes set the excluded part is
charged against the budget, throttling the scheme to a fraction of what
was configured.

User impact is that DAMOS could unexpectedly slowly run, due to
over-charged quota.  DAMOS stat could also be confusing.  No critical
events such as crashes or leask happen.

Re-read the region size after the core filters have run.
