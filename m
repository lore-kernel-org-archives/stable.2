The quilt patch titled

has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ocfs2-dlm-serialize-migration-mle-cleanup-on-failure.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-nonmm-hotfixes-stable branch

Subject: ocfs2/dlm: serialize migration MLE cleanup on failure
Date: Tue, 27 Oct 2026 18:14:49 +0800

A migration MLE has a base reference for the mastering answer and an
in-use reference held by dlm_migrate_lockres(). The finishing assertion
consumes the base reference, but migration failure drops it again
without checking whether the assertion already consumed it.

The target queues its migration worker before it acknowledges the
ALL_DONE packet, so its finishing assertion can be handled while the
sender still waits for the status. If the connection fails before the
status arrives, dlm_send_one_lockres() returns an error for a migration
that the target has already completed:

  Old-master sender                  Finishing assertion
  -----------------                  -------------------
  publish MLE; take in-use reference
  send ALL_DONE; wait for status
                                     take lookup reference
                                     unlink MLE
                                     put lookup and base references
  send returns a connection error
  put base reference again; free MLE
  put in-use reference; access freed MLE

dlm_assert_master_handler() holds dlm->spinlock from the MLE lookup to
the final puts, and it takes dlm->master_lock around the unlink and the
puts. Decide under the same locks: if the MLE is already unhashed, the
assertion consumed the base reference, so drop only the sender's in-use
reference. Otherwise unlink it before consuming the base reference so a
later assertion no longer finds it.

An assertion that got there first has also made the target the owner
and cleared DLM_LOCK_RES_MIGRATING. Treating the attempt as failed at
that point would leave the lockres owned by the target while this node
still holds the other nodes' locks and refmap bits, so it could neither
be purged nor migrated again. Finish our side as a completed migration
does instead: drop those locks under res->spinlock if the target still
owns the lockres, and recalculate its usage.

Use the same cleanup for the pre-send failure, the send failure and the
target-death failure paths. The sender's in-use reference keeps the MLE
alive until its final put outside the nested locks. Successful
migration retains its existing in-use-only put.

A target that has died cannot assert after the sender has seen its
death. The o2net node-down callback runs before the DLM one; it
disconnects the node and flushes the workqueue that runs the message
handlers, so an assertion already received has been handled by the time
the DLM removes the node from the domain map. A node that leaves the
domain cleanly sends its exit message only after its assertions have
been answered.

Two windows of the hand-over itself are left as they are: the handler
switches the owner and the sender drops the other nodes' locks moments
later, and an assertion from a live target that arrives after the
sender has given up still meets the owner check in the handler. Waiting
for the target before giving up would only stretch the first window
into the time in which recovery of the target can observe it.
