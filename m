From: Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 6857e209015f95be7a8f19a9cd5dac345b9b9859 ]

The propagate_mount_busy() helper exists to decide whether a synchronous
can suceed. It does that by looking at the copies of the victims in the
mounts its parent propagates to. One of those functions from propagation
hell.

It skips a copy that has child mounts except for the case of a single
child mount covering the copy's root. That algorithm used to be exact.
It isn't anymore.

Originally only childless copies were unmounted during propagation.
And 1064f874abc0 ("mnt: Tuck mounts under others instead of creating
shadow/side mounts.") ended up adding covered mounts to both sides in
one go.

Along came 99b19d16471e ("mnt: In propgate_umount handle visiting mounts
in any order") and that started to unmount more than before:

[1]: A copy of a mount is unmounted when each of its children is either
     its overmount or a copy of the victim itself. In the former case
     the overmount gets reparented. In the latter case the copy of the
     victim will end up being unmounted.

So propagate_umount() ended up being rewritten without adjusting
propagate_mount_busy(). And currently propagate_mount_busy() doesn't
look at copies of the victim that have two or more children nor a single
child that is not the overmount.

So any such copy in [1] is not checked for
references. The result is that a synchronous unmount succeeds, pulling
out a mount that is still in use.

A container can run into this with its own mounts. The host shares a
tree with the container and the host has a mount in that tree:

  mount -t tmpfs none /mnt
  mount --make-shared /mnt
  mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/a

The container's /mnt is a slave copy of the host mount. The container
now takes a detached copy of the tree and mounts that copy beneath its
propagated copy of /mnt/a and keeps the file descriptor to the tree
open:

  unshare -m --propagation unchanged
  mount --make-rslave /
  fd = open_tree(AT_FDCWD, "/mnt", OPEN_TREE_CLONE | AT_RECURSIVE)
  move_mount(fd, "", AT_FDCWD, "/mnt/a", MOVE_MOUNT_BENEATH)

  grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo
  775 355 ... /mnt ...     master:646
  777 775 ... /mnt/a ...   master:646
  776 777 ... /mnt/a ...   master:647
  778 777 ... /mnt/a/a ... master:647

The now attached tree (777) is now mounted beneath the container's copy
of /mnt/a. That's also where the host mount sits (as seen from the host
mount namespace). So the propagated copy (776) of the host's mount is on
top of its root and the copy of that (778) is inside it. Now the host
runs:

  umount /mnt/a

and it succeeds. The moved tree tree and the copy inside of it are gone
from the container. Now only the propagated copy is left and it got
reparented to where it was before:

  grep /mnt /proc/self/mountinfo
  775 355 ... /mnt ... master:646
  776 775 ... /mnt/a ...

But the file descriptor still refers to the moved tree. So a synchronous
umount detached a mount that is still in use.

Teach propagate_mount_busy() the same checks that propagate_umount()
does. It now checks for a single victim mount without children
for which it can assume that MNT_LOCKED is cleared on every copy like
propagate_umount() does. The copies form chains. IOW, when a copy itself
receives propagation from the victim's parent then the mount at the same
mountpoint inside that copy is a copy as well. Whether a mount receives
propagation from the victim's can simply be checked by walking its
masters. Walk each chain once from its top so we are sure that nested
copies stay linear. Check every reference once of every copy that gets
unmounted.

[ sashal: Replaced the missing m->overmount with a root-mountpoint check and scaled the refcount check by the number of allowed children, since children pin their parent here; removed the unused find_topper(). ]
