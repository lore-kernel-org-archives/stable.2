net/smc: Serialize early link group cleanup with termination

This commit makes smc_lgr_cleanup_early() check and claim lgr->freeing
under lgr_lock before it calls __smc_lgr_terminate(). This stops early
cleanup from racing with the other teardown paths. It also makes
smc_conn_abort() hold a temporary link group reference across
smc_conn_free() and early cleanup.

[Severity: High]
This adds a reference for the smc_conn_abort() caller, because the new
lgr->freeing check needs the link group to still be allocated. Does the
other caller of smc_lgr_cleanup_early() need the same protection?

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_create() {
    ...
		write_lock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock);
		rc = smc_lgr_register_conn(conn, true);
		write_unlock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock);
		if (rc) {
			smc_lgr_cleanup_early(lgr);
			goto out;
		}
	}
	smc_lgr_hold(conn->lgr); /* lgr_put in smc_conn_free() */
    ...
}

The hold is only taken after registration succeeds. On the failure path,
smc_lgr_cleanup_early() runs without a reference of its own.

For SMC-R first contact, smc_lgr_register_conn() fails through
smcr_lgr_conn_assign_link() only when the new link is no longer
SMC_LNK_ACTIVATING. As far as I can tell, that happens only when
__smcr_link_clear() resets the link inside a teardown's smc_lgr_free(). That
teardown drops the link's lgr reference and then the initial one. For
example:

smc_smcr_terminate_all(NULL)   /* reboot notifier via smc_lgrs_shutdown() */
    list_splice_init(&smc_lgr_list.list, &lgr_free_list);
    lgr->freeing = 1;
    __smc_lgr_terminate(lgr, false)
        smc_lgr_free()
            smcr_link_clear()->__smcr_link_clear()  /* link UNUSED, lgr put */
            smc_lgr_put(lgr); /* theoretically last lgr_put */
                __smc_lgr_free()->kfree(lgr)

The connecting thread (connect() or the smc_hs_wq listen worker) then sees
registration fail and calls smc_lgr_cleanup_early() on the freed lgr. There,
smc_lgr_list_head() reads lgr->is_smcd and the new check reads
lgr->freeing.

The commit message says:

    The extra reference keeps the group alive until early cleanup has
    checked teardown ownership.

The smc_conn_create() caller has the same lifetime requirement. Is a
use-after-free from early cleanup racing with termination still reachable
through that path? The window is narrow. It looks like it needs a teardown
such as a reboot to run during an SMC-R first-contact handshake.

[Severity: Medium]
Can early cleanup free the link group while a smc_lgr_free_work() callback
that has already started is still using it?

After freeing is claimed here, __smc_lgr_terminate() only does a
non-synchronous cancel:

net/smc/smc_core.c:__smc_lgr_terminate() {
    ...
	/* cancel free_work sync, will terminate when lgr->freeing is set */
	cancel_delayed_work(&lgr->free_work);
	lgr->terminating = 1;
    ...
}

free_work is queued on system_percpu_wq, not lgr->tx_wq. So
destroy_workqueue(lgr->tx_wq) in smc_lgr_free() does not flush it. The
callback also holds no lgr reference.

Suppose the callback has started but has not yet reached the freeing check:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_lgr_free_work() {
    ...
	smc_lgr_list_head(lgr, &lgr_lock);
	spin_lock_bh(lgr_lock);
	if (lgr->freeing) {
    ...
}

Teardown can then run to completion. smc_lgr_free() drops the initial
reference, and the new smc_lgr_put() in smc_conn_abort() drops the last
one. __smc_lgr_free() then frees the lgr and its embedded free_work, and
the callback goes on to dereference freed memory.

The commit message says:

    This also prevents early cleanup from racing with the delayed free
    worker

It looks like the freeing flag only prevents a second teardown while the
object is still allocated. It does not keep the lgr alive for a worker that
lost the race. Is the commit message accurate here?

To trigger this, the SMC_LGR_FREE_DELAY_* timer has to expire during the
creator's abort. That looks like it needs an unusual stall or a jiffies
jump.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the comment in
__smc_lgr_terminate() quoted above says "cancel free_work sync". The code
calls cancel_delayed_work(), which does not wait for a callback that is
already running.

What protects a pending smc_lgr_free_work() is its own re-check of
lgr->freeing under lgr_lock, not a synchronous cancel. Early cleanup now
reaches this code after claiming freeing. Could the comment be updated to
match the code?
