Hi Gerd,

You're right that this ends up as a ~1s retry loop.  While that may
not be pretty, I think it's still the right call for a net/stable
fix, for a few reasons.

First, it's already what we do for the same condition in the other
direction.  When the passive side rejects us with RDS_RDMA_REJ_INCOMPAT,
the REJECTED case in rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() calls
rds_conn_drop(), we reconnect with the usual backoff (capped at
rds_sysctl_reconnect_max_jiffies, one second), and we log a pr_warn
on every attempt.  That's the common direction, a new node talking to
an old one.  Aohan's patch just makes the rare direction behave the
same way instead of wedging.

Second, rds_conn_destroy() doesn't actually give up on the peer either.
Nothing in RDS remembers that a peer is incompatible.  Destroy frees
the conn, and the next rds_sendmsg() to that address either reuses the
socket's cached rs->rs_conn or goesthrough rds_conn_create_outgoing()
and rds_conn_connect_if_down() and then connects again.  With an
application actively sending, that's a create/connect/mismatch/destroy
cycle at the application level.  With an idle application the only
difference from the drop is whether the retry is timer-driven or
send-driven.  Deferring the destroy to a worker doesn't change that
picture, it just avoids the deadlock.

While that code path does have bugs, making rds_conn_destroy()
safe to call from the CM path is a much bigger change, and one that
should probably go through net-next rather than holding up a small
fix like this.  The current code hangs every RDS connection on the
node the first time this fires, and a one second retry on one conn is
strictly better than that.

I do think there's potential for a good follow-up in what you're
describing through. A separate patch could fix both directions at
once: a per-conn flag set from the REJ_INCOMPAT case and from this one
that makes rds_conn_shutdown() skip the timer-driven rds_queue_reconnect().
Then the conn would then sit in RDS_CONN_DOWN until a socket actually sends
to it.  At which point rds_conn_connect_if_down() gives the peer another
chance in case it was upgraded.  That also gets rid of the once-a-second
log line, which we have today on the REJECTED side too.  That seems like
net-next material to me rather than something to hold this fix on, but
I'd be happy to review it.

I also think it's worth pointing out which peers this actually affects.
Upstream has RDS_PROTOCOL_VERSION and RDS_PROTOCOL_COMPAT_VERSION both
at 3.1.  So this branch only fires for a 3.0 peer (OFED 1.3 era) or for
an accept that carries no or truncated private data.  That would leave
c_version at 0 on a fresh conn.  In practice that's a broken or non-RDS
peer on the RDS port, not a cluster of un-upgraded nodes. So retrying
those on a backoff like any other unreachable peer seems appropriate.

Thanks,
