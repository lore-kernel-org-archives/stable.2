net/smc: fix lgr/lnk lifetime vs diag reader race

This patch unhashes SMC sockets in smc_close_active_abort() and
smc_close_passive_work() before smc_conn_free() drops the lgr/lnk
references. It also makes __smc_diag_dump() skip the conn/lgr/lnk
attribute blocks when the socket is in SMC_INIT or SMC_CLOSED state. The
goal is to keep the diag reader from dereferencing a freed link group or
link.

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message says the socket is unhashed "before smc_conn_free() is
called at the two terminal teardown sites". This unhash, though, runs
unconditionally for every state. Is that intended?

The SMC_ACTIVE, SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT1 and SMC_APPCLOSEWAIT2 branches never call
smc_conn_free(). They only set SMC_CLOSED and call sock_put(). SMC_INIT,
SMC_PEERABORTWAIT and SMC_CLOSED don't call it either. Neither does the early
break taken when smc_close_cancel_work() changes the state.

On link group termination, smc_conn_kill() calls smc_close_active_abort()
for every connection:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_kill() {
    ...
    smc_lgr_unregister_conn(conn);
    smc_close_active_abort(smc);
}

Doesn't this make killed SMC_ACTIVE sockets vanish from smc_diag/smcss
right away instead of at close? The application still has them open, and
their lgr/lnk references are still held.

These sockets reach smc_conn_free() later in __smc_release(), which already
unhashes first. smc_release() is also a third caller of
smc_close_active_abort(), and the commit message doesn't mention it.

Would it be narrower to unhash only right before the two smc_conn_free()
calls in the SMC_PEERCLOSEWAIT1/2/SMC_PEERFINCLOSEWAIT and
SMC_PROCESSABORT/SMC_APPFINCLOSEWAIT branches?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch. Still, on
the smc_conn_kill() path this new unhash runs too late to protect against
it.

On SMC-D with dmb_nocopy (for example loopback-ism), smc_conn_kill() frees
the sndbuf descriptor before it unregisters the conn and before it calls
smc_close_active_abort():

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_kill() {
    ...
    if (smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy(conn->lgr->smcd))
        smcd_buf_detach(conn);
    ...
    smc_lgr_unregister_conn(conn);
    smc_close_active_abort(smc);
}

smcd_buf_detach() does this:

    buf_desc = conn->sndbuf_desc;
    conn->sndbuf_desc = NULL;
    kfree(buf_desc);

During that window the socket is still hashed and still in SMC_ACTIVE, so
it passes the new diag guard. alert_token_local is also still set. That
means __smc_diag_dump() enters the SMC_DIAG_CONNINFO block and evaluates:

    .sndbuf_size = conn->sndbuf_desc ?
        conn->sndbuf_desc->len : 0,

These are plain loads, and only the hash read_lock is held. Could this
dereference NULL, or read ->len from an smc_buf_desc that has been kfree'd?
The lock_sock() in __smc_lgr_terminate() does not exclude the diag reader.

Would unhashing at the start of smc_conn_kill(), before smcd_buf_detach(),
close this as well?

[Severity: High]
Does this guard cover the lgr dereference earlier in __smc_diag_dump() that
sets r->diag_mode?

net/smc/smc_diag.c:__smc_diag_dump() {
    ...
    if (smc->use_fallback)
        r->diag_mode = SMC_DIAG_MODE_FALLBACK_TCP;
    else if (smc_conn_lgr_valid(&smc->conn) && smc->conn.lgr->is_smcd)
        r->diag_mode = SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCD;
    ...
}

That load happens before the new SMC_INIT/SMC_CLOSED check, and only the
smc hash read_lock is held.

The commit message says this guard handles the smc_conn_abort() SMC_INIT
case. Take a handshake failure such as smc_listen_decline() ->
smc_conn_abort(new_smc, local_first). The socket is still hashed in
SMC_INIT and use_fallback has not been set yet:

net/smc/af_smc.c:smc_conn_abort() {
    ...
    smc_conn_free(conn);
    if (local_first && lgr_valid)
        smc_lgr_cleanup_early(lgr);
}

The following chain then frees the lgr synchronously:

smc_lgr_cleanup_early()
  __smc_lgr_terminate()
    smc_lgr_free()
      smc_lgr_put()
        __smc_lgr_free()
          kfree(lgr)

Nothing on this path takes the hash write_lock, and conn->lgr is never
cleared. smc_conn_lgr_valid() is only plain loads of conn->lgr and
conn->alert_token_local.

Can a diag reader pass smc_conn_lgr_valid() just before the conn is
unregistered, and then read lgr->is_smcd after the kfree()?

smc_diag_handler_dump() has no capability check, and a remote peer can
cause the handshake failure. Would checking the state (or use_fallback)
before any conn.lgr access close this?

>  	if ((req->diag_ext & (1 << (SMC_DIAG_CONNINFO - 1))) &&
>  	    smc->conn.alert_token_local) {
>  		struct smc_connection *conn = &smc->conn;

[Severity: High]
Sockets in SMC_ACTIVE and the closing states still get past this guard. Is
the SMC_DIAG_LGRINFO block further down still exposed to a concurrent link
switch?

net/smc/smc_diag.c:__smc_diag_dump() {
    ...
    struct smc_link *link = smc->conn.lnk;
    ...
    memcpy(linfo.lnk[0].ibname, link->smcibdev->ibdev->name,
           sizeof(link->smcibdev->ibdev->name));
    ...
}

Only the hash read_lock is held here. During SMC-R link failover,
smcr_link_down() -> smc_switch_conns() -> smc_switch_link_and_count()
replaces conn->lnk under conn->send_lock and drops the conn's reference on
the old link:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_switch_link_and_count() {
    ...
    smcr_link_put(conn->lnk);
    conn->lnk = to_lnk;
    ...
}

When smcr_link_clear() drops the last reference, __smcr_link_clear() calls
put_device() on the ibdev and then memset(lnk, 0). The lgr stays on its
list during failover, so the !list_empty(&smc->conn.lgr->list) check does
not stop the reader.

Suppose a reader loads the old link pointer just before the switch. Can it
then see link->smcibdev == NULL and oops? That is the same signature that
9dbe086c69b8 fixed. It could also read the name of an ibdev that has
already been released.

Unhashing before smc_conn_free() does not cover this path. The v2
serialisation of the conn->lnk swap against the reader was dropped in this
version, and nothing replaces it.
