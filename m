net/smc: fix lgr/lnk lifetime vs diag reader race

The patch closes races between the SMC diag dump and connection teardown.
It skips the conn/lgr/lnk attribute blocks for SMC_INIT and SMC_CLOSED
sockets, and pairs smp_load_acquire()/smp_store_release() on sk_state. It
also unhashes the socket before smc_conn_free() or smcd_buf_detach() in
several teardown paths, and copies the cached link->ibname.

[Severity: Low]
Is this change to diag_mode intended? With the new r->diag_state !=
SMC_INIT check, every non-fallback SMC_INIT socket falls into the else
branch and is reported as SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCR.

Before this patch, an SMC_INIT socket with a registered SMC-D link group
was reported as SMC_DIAG_MODE_SMCD.

On the client side, this window runs from smc_conn_create() in
smc_connect_ism() until the smp_store_release() to SMC_ACTIVE. On the
server side it lasts until smc_listen_out_connected(), which includes
waiting for the peer's CLC CONFIRM. During that time, sock_diag users see
an SMC-D connection labelled as SMC-R. The "Mode of a connection" enum in
include/uapi/linux/smc_diag.h has no "unknown" value for this case.

The commit message says:

  "Guard the conn/lgr/lnk blocks in __smc_diag_dump() for SMC_INIT and
   SMC_CLOSED sockets; smcss already suppresses these attributes for
   closed/unconnected sockets so there is no observability regression."

It doesn't mention the diag_mode change, which only appears in the v6
changelog below the --- line.

Could the transport type be recorded in a field of struct smc_sock when
the lgr is assigned? That would avoid both the lgr dereference and the
wrong mode.

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message says the conn/lgr/lnk blocks are guarded for both
SMC_INIT and SMC_CLOSED. The diag_mode selection above excludes only
SMC_INIT, and it runs before this early exit.

For an SMC_CLOSED socket, can __smc_diag_dump() still call
smc_conn_lgr_valid() and then dereference smc->conn.lgr->is_smcd?

In the server handshake error path, a CLOSED socket stays hashed after
its conn has been freed:

smc_listen_decline()
  smc_conn_abort()
    smc_conn_free()
      smc_lgr_unregister_conn()
        write_lock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock);
        __smc_lgr_unregister_conn()
          conn->alert_token_local = 0;
        write_unlock_bh(&lgr->conns_lock);
      smcr_link_put(conn->lnk);
      smc_lgr_put(lgr);          <-- conn->lgr is left set
  smc_listen_out_err()
    newsmcsk->sk_state = SMC_CLOSED;

The SMC_CLOSED store in smc_listen_out_err() is a plain store, not the
smp_store_release() this patch adds for SMC_ACTIVE.

Between the alert_token_local reset and the CLOSED store, the only
operations are release-ordered ones: write_unlock_bh(),
refcount_dec_and_test() via smcr_link_put()/smc_lgr_put(), and
sock_put(). None of them orders the later CLOSED store.

On a weakly ordered CPU such as arm64, could the reader's
smp_load_acquire() see SMC_CLOSED while alert_token_local still reads as
non-zero? The reader would then dereference an lgr that the connection no
longer holds a reference to. If link-group freeing runs concurrently,
that read is a use-after-free.

This needs a non-local-first lgr with a negative reason code, so that
smc_lgr_cleanup_early() is not called. The window is narrow.

Would it help to exclude SMC_CLOSED from the diag_mode condition as well,
or to move this early exit ahead of the diag_mode selection? Publishing
SMC_CLOSED in smc_listen_out_err() with smp_store_release() would also
close the gap.
