I don't agree on this.

Here what we are changing is the UAPI behaviour, which should not be
constrained by what smcss did.

And SMC_INIT can coexist with fallback. For example:

smc_sendmsg() calls smc_switch_to_fallback(SMC_CLC_DECL_OPTUNSUPP) under
MSG_FASTOPEN while sk_state is SMC_INIT and never changes it afterwards --
fastopen does not call connect(), so the state never goes to SMC_ACTIVE.

I didn't have any better ideas to fix this issue with minimal changes.
So I agree that we can go with this the fix.

Your are right.

Great!
