ice_tx_hang_reporter_dump() always reads tx_ring->tx_buf[0].skb,
regardless of next_to_clean. The Tx cleanup path frees the skb and
marks the buffer empty without clearing the skb pointer, so slot 0 can
hold a stale pointer. A NULL check alone does not cover this, and
devlink_fmsg_dump_skb() can fault on the freed skb.

Using tx_buf[next_to_clean] alone does not fix the lifetime issues.
The dump runs from the service task without synchronization with Tx
cleanup or ring replacement:

- ice_clean_tx_irq() can free the skb at next_to_clean while the
  report is being prepared. It calls napi_consume_skb() before
  marking the buffer empty.
- The ring saved by ice_tx_timeout() can be replaced or freed before
  the service task runs. ethtool -G replaces the ring contents and
  frees tx_buf and desc, while ethtool -L can free whole rings.

Record the queue index, next_to_clean and next_to_use at timeout time.
Before reporting, take RTNL and check that the timeout was on the PF
VSI, that the VSI is up and that the timed-out queue still maps to the
saved ring. A freed ring can be reused for another queue, so a pointer
match alone is not enough. Copy the descriptors and IRQ name while the
ring storage is protected against replacement. If the check fails or
the copy cannot be made, report only the values recorded at timeout
time.

As before this patch, a successful snapshot shows the ring when the
report is generated. A reset of the same queue after the timeout, for
example by ethtool -G or an MTU change, is not detected.

Tx cleanup can still run while the ring state is copied, so do not
dereference the skb. Retain only its pointer value in the dump and
remove the skb contents.

Release RTNL before calling devlink_health_report(), which takes the
devlink instance lock. Build the dump from the copied data and free
the descriptor copy after reporting.

This leaves devlink_fmsg_dump_skb() without users; its removal is left
to a net-next follow-up.

Observed on an E810 PF passed through to a KVM guest with Ubuntu
kernel 7.0.0-14 (PREEMPT_RT and a local scheduler patch): a delayed
queue IRQ led to a Tx timeout and a page fault in
devlink_fmsg_dump_skb():

Changes in v4:
- Use the saved ring only if the timeout was on the PF VSI and the
  timed-out queue still maps to it. A pointer match alone accepted a
  freed ring reused for another queue (Sashiko).
- Read the saved ring pointer before taking RTNL, alongside the
  timeout-time values, as before this patch. This avoids rereading
  the pointer after the RTNL wait, but does not make the event
  snapshot atomic (Sashiko).
- Clarify that a successful snapshot shows the ring at report time,
  as before, and that a reset of the same queue is not detected.
  v3 implied that ring replacement was detected (Sashiko).
- Carry Przemek's Reviewed-by; the only code changes are the VSI/queue
  check and the saved pointer read above.
- Leave removal of the unused devlink_fmsg_dump_skb() export to a
  net-next follow-up, and say so in the commit message (Sashiko).
- Document the pre-existing reload deadlock separately under
  Limitations.
- Run hardware tests of v4; see "Testing of v4". The v2 stress
  campaign was not repeated.

Changes in v3:
- Glue the kvfree() of the descriptor copy to the preceding if as an
  else (Przemek).
- Reword the ice_tx_hang_snapshot() kernel-doc: it said the rings are
  only replaced or freed under RTNL or from the service task, which does
  not hold for driver removal and devlink reload (Sashiko). No code
  change for this.
- Carry Przemek's Reviewed-by; the only code change is the else above.
- Move the AI-assistance attribution from the commit trailers to
  the notes below.

Changes in v2:
- Validate the saved ring under RTNL before dereferencing it from
  the service task, and restrict snapshots to the PF VSI while it
  is up (Sashiko).
- Check next_to_clean against count before indexing tx_buf, and
  copy the descriptors and IRQ name while ring replacement is
  excluded (Sashiko).
- Stop dereferencing the skb and remove its contents from the dump.
  Keep only its pointer value (Sashiko).
- Release RTNL before reporting to preserve the devlink instance
  lock ordering.
- Record the queue index and ring indices at timeout time as a
  fallback when a snapshot cannot be made.
- Drop Paul's Reviewed-by because the patch changed substantially.

AI assistance: Claude (claude-sonnet-5-5) for earlier revisions;
Copilot for the v4 queue validation and pointer-read changes, review
analysis, and commit message and revision notes.

Testing of v4:
- Built all ice objects and linked ice.o on the exact base below with
  x86_64 defconfig, CONFIG_ICE=m, GCC 15.2.0, W=1 and sparse C=2
  (sparse git 84ec065).
  The compiler and sparse reported no warnings or errors.
- checkpatch --strict on the full patch: 0 errors, warnings or checks.
- Runtime tests used a backport, not the exact net tree. The ice module
  was built from upstream v7.0 with the v4 changes to
  ice_tx_hang_snapshot() and ice_report_tx_hang(), plus an unrelated PTP
  lifetime fix, and run on an E810 PF passed through to a KVM guest with
  a PREEMPT_RT 7.0.0-38 kernel, KASAN, PROVE_LOCKING and
  DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP.
- Test-only hooks stop Tx cleaning on one queue of the test PF and delay
  ice_report_tx_hang() or the dump callback. The stall is released at
  the first timeout, so recovery stayed at a PF reset. A racing command
  was started when the hook logged its delay.
- Forced Tx timeout with automatic dump: 3 runs, complete dump.
- ethtool -G tx 64 while ice_report_tx_hang() was delayed: 2 runs, the
  dump showed the replaced ring.
- ethtool -G tx 64 while the dump callback was delayed: 2 runs, the dump
  was built from the copy.
- ethtool -L combined 1 while ice_report_tx_hang() was delayed: 4 runs.
  The channel change is refused while RDMA is active, so irdma was
  unbound from the test PF through sysfs first. The report then
  contained only head, intr, vsi_num, queue, next_to_clean and
  next_to_use, without the ring-derived fields.
- No KASAN, lockdep or sleeping-in-atomic report was seen in these
  runs, and lockdep stayed enabled for the whole boot.
- Reuse of a freed ring by another queue was not reproduced. The
  queue check was compared with ice_vsi_alloc_rings(), where q_index is
  the tx_rings array index. The ethtool -G runs reset the same queue in
  place; as described above, this is not detected and the dump shows the
  ring as it is when the report is generated.
- Other observations during testing, not investigated: the kernel logged
  order-9 allocation failures in irdma during PF recovery, and an
  ip link down/up attempted while a reset was pending produced an RTNL
  assertion warning in ice_dis_vsi() -> ice_vsi_close() on the service
  task reset path.

Testing of earlier revisions:
- Built ice.ko with x86_64 defconfig, CONFIG_ICE=m, GCC 12.2 and W=1.
  Ran sparse with C=2 (sparse git c464045). Neither reported warnings
  in the changed files.
- checkpatch --strict reported only an unknown Fixes commit because
  the local tree is a shallow clone.
- Runtime testing used an E810 PF passed through to a KVM guest with
  Ubuntu kernel 7.0.0-38 (PREEMPT_RT), KASAN, PROVE_LOCKING and
  DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP.
- Forced Tx timeouts by starving one queue's IRQ thread. The watchdog
  fired after five seconds, the PF recovered, and the dump retained
  the v1 fields except for the skb contents.
- Used a test-only kernel patch to insert configurable delays before
  ice_report_tx_hang() or the dump callback. Racing ethtool commands
  were started when the instrumentation logged the delay.
- With v1 and the same instrumentation, shrinking the ring with
  ethtool -G tx 64 while next_to_clean was above 64 triggered a KASAN
  slab-out-of-bounds report. This was also reproduced on a non-RT
  kernel built from net. Racing ethtool -L combined 1 triggered a
  use-after-free followed by a general protection fault.
- With v2, ran 168 forced Tx timeouts, including 149 with concurrent
  ethtool -G (tx 64, 128 or 512) or ethtool -L combined 1, before and
  after the ring state was copied. No KASAN, lockdep or
  sleeping-in-atomic reports were observed. When the saved ring was
  no longer present, the dump contained only the timeout-time values.

Limitations:
- The v4 runs were short: two to four per scenario, not a repeat of the
  168 timeouts run with v2. The same stress testing was not completed
  on a non-RT kernel, where Tx timeouts could not be forced reliably.
- Subfunction VSIs and XDP were not tested. Subfunction VSI rings
  are excluded from the snapshot because ice_sf_dev_remove() frees
  them without RTNL.
- Driver removal and devlink reload still stop the service task only after
  the devlink reporter and the VSIs are torn down, and the service task
  runs the Tx hang report before it checks ICE_SERVICE_DIS. Before this
  patch the same path dereferenced the saved ring with no protection at
  all. The ordering is left to a separate fix.
- DRIVER_REINIT reload can deadlock: it holds the devlink instance
  lock while waiting for the service task to stop, and the service
  task's devlink_health_report() path may need that lock for auto-dump.
  This pre-existing locking issue is left to a separate fix.
- This patch does not synchronize publication and consumption of
  tx_hang_buf between ice_tx_timeout() and the service task. A newer
  timeout may still be dropped or its fields mixed with an older
  event. The ring is only used if it matches the recorded VSI and
  queue.

The original devlink_fmsg_dump_skb() crash was reproduced on Ubuntu
kernel 7.0.0-14 with PREEMPT_RT and a local scheduler patch. The
additional race reproductions above used test-only instrumentation.
The affected reporter code is also present in upstream net at
191aa4154.
