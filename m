Part 1/7 of "proc: move procfs to what kernfs does", the base of the
other six parts:

  https://patch.msgid.link/20261104-work-procfs-v2-0-b45cd5789ac5@brauner

Moving procfs to what kernfs does touches just about every
->proc_read(), ->proc_write() and ->proc_ioctl() in the tree. Reviewing
that turned up bugs that have nothing to do with the conversion and are
a lot older. They go first so they can go to stable on their own. Four
selftests come with them.

In procfs itself:

- readdir resumed a listing at a counted position, so an entry that came
  or went in between repeated or skipped one, and it ended a listing
  early when the entry it was emitting went away. It resumes after the
  last name now, like kernfs. /proc/sys had the same bug.
- /proc/sys readdir ended a listing early at an entry that was being
  unregistered, so getdents64() reported EOF with entries left.
- /proc/sys copied to and from userspace with the table held, so a read,
  write or getdents64() that faults for as long as userspace wants kept
  unregister_sysctl_table() waiting, which addrconf calls under RTNL.
- proc_sys_make_inode() read the table after it had dropped sysctl_lock.
- a symlink's entry stayed pinned while readlink() copied it out, so a
  faulting readlink() held up remove_proc_entry(). ALSA removes its card
  links with snd_card_mutex held.
- name resolution walked through regular files, and pktgen lets
  userspace pick names, so an unprivileged user could hang an entry
  below another file and get it freed. pktgen refuses a '/' now.
- proc_register() WARNed on a duplicate name, which pktgen's names can
  provoke.
- proc_remove() removed by name, so removing an entry that was already
  gone could take out a different one.
- the parent of entries a dying network namespace left in /proc/net was
  freed silently. procfs warns now.
- on NOMMU every /proc file could be mapped privately, which reads it
  with nommu_region_sem held, and /proc/maps takes that lock. Any user
  could hang the machine.
- sunrpc queued the pollers of its channel files on a wait queue in the
  per-namespace cache_detail, which is freed with the namespace. Back to
  one static queue here, the conversion makes procfs own the queues.
- vmcore_cleanup() could run twice at once.

In the handlers:

- PCI/proc and isapnp truncated the position to an int, so a pwrite()
  or pread() at a huge offset went negative and accessed config space
  far outside the file.
- dasd looked in front of its buffer on an empty write.
- toshiba_acpi's brightness and fan write checks could never fail.
- simdisk read the file name without the lock that protects it, so a
  reader could copy out memory a concurrent detach had freed.
- rtas_flash read past its validate message, and rtasd handed out what
  vmalloc() left in its log buffer.
- ALSA's info layer let a write past the end of a data entry through
  unclamped.
- BusLogic, ips and libipw returned 0 from writes, so stdio writers
  retry forever.
- the scsi host files and um's /proc/exitcode parsed writes without
  NUL-terminating them.
- ntfs3 tripped the page allocator's warning on a huge label write.
- esas2r took the lengths of its HBA, SMP and firmware ioctls from
  userspace unchecked, through a file everyone can open.
- powerpc's copy_oldmem_page() didn't check ioremap_cache() and only
  recovered from a machine check for read(), the pseries ofdt parser
  read past its input, and lparcfg reported a failed hcall as a huge
  write.
- alloc_tag removed /proc/allocinfo with the codetag module lock held
  when a module's tags couldn't be reserved, and a reader of the file
  takes that lock with the entry pinned, so the module load and the
  reader waited for each other for good.
- esas2r copied the kernel addresses of the adapter, its pci_dev and its
  Scsi_Host out through the 0444 ATTONode.
- cs46xx stored the chip in the private data of its region files and
  read it back as the region.
- isapnp went on talking to whatever device the card had selected, and
  unlocked a mutex it never took, when isapnp_cfg_begin() refused a
  logical device number.
- simdisk freed the gendisk before it removed the entry, so a write in
  between set the capacity of a freed disk.
- the pseries ofdt commands leaked a node reference per property
  command, and lockd handed out the NUL behind "Y\n".
- lparcfg and psi overwrote the last byte of a write to terminate it,
  so a write without a trailing newline lost a character.
- the sparc LED and rtas progress files consumed only the start of a
  write, so a looping writer sent the rest as a second command.
- profiling reported success when /proc/profile couldn't be created,
  and zorro sized its files like a zorro_dev instead of the ConfigDev
  they serve.

The xt_recent deadlock v1 fixed here goes in through netfilter instead.

The procfs, sysctl, readlink, pktgen, sunrpc, PCI and duplicate name
bugs reproduce on a KASAN and lockdep kernel in a VM and are gone with
the series. The rest is build tested.

Changes in v2:
- thirteen more fixes that the review of v1 turned up: alloc_tag,
  esas2r, cs46xx, isapnp, simdisk, pseries ofdt, lockd, lparcfg, psi,
  the sparc LED, rtas progress, profiling and zorro
- the NOMMU, crash_dump and lparcfg patches say more about the bug
- new patch: sysctl readdir ended a listing early when an entry was
  being unregistered, pre-existing
- the xt_recent patch is dropped, Cen Zhang's fix for the same lock is
  on its way through netfilter
- the readdir churn selftests skip instead of failing without
  /dev/net/tun, the sysctl removal selftest seeks past the dots first so
  its fault lands in an entry, the selftests' Makefile, .gitignore and
  config lines sit in the series that adds each test
- struct sysctl_dirent loses its unused mode
- Reviewed-by and Acked-by from Rafael, Takashi and Chuck
- rebased onto v7.4-rc1
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20261102-work-procfs-bugfixes-v1-0-59422ed3e465@kernel.org
