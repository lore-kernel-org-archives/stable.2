Don't take the design doc as being complete or correct - it's a
working document and really only serves as the initial high level
plan I fleshed out.

Indeed, I implemented a chunk of it yesterday afternoon (i.e.
before I saw your patch this morning) and my findings change quite a
bit of the generic infrastructure to make it handle the transaction
header without having to special case it. So from that perspective,
it's already out of date...

I'll post what I have in the series later this afternoon so you can
get up to speed.

The iterator structure behind the item decoding should handle
decoding regions split into an arbitrary number of ophdr regions
without issue.

That's kinda the point of it; ensure the region is
fully extracted from the journal before we try to decode any of it.
Hence we have to handle CONTINUE/WAS_CONT regions as partial
additives until we get to the final WAS_CONT region that closes off
the region as a whole.

Real thing, go look at xlog_write_get_iclog_space() and
consider what happens when the lv_chain passed to xlog_write() gets
it's first iclog with only space for two ophdrs left in it....

The special case handling for it is awful, and IMO needs to go away
because it is actually buggy and makes it much harder to reason
about what is a valid item in a transaction....

This is why I have been rewriting xfs_logprint in rust: so it has
the same capabilities as xfs_db in terms of being able to walk,
parse and modify individual items in the journal. i.e. to be able to
explicitly fuzz the journal in a systematic, programmable and
reproducable way and hence avoid the need for hundreds of corrupted
images to test all the corner cases....

And, FWIW, the iterator + generic item handling design of the
validator for the kernel code is a fairly close translation of the
layered generic item type verification my new rust logprint code
already uses.

We have extensive journal recovery stress and validity tests in
fstests (e.g. the recoveryloop group), and so I'm really not worried
about structure verification being too strict. I'd much prefer to
err on the "extremely strict" side right now, and loosen if needed.
I don't think it will be an issue, because if the journal
verification comes across improperly formatted items then it points
to a runtime bug that needs to be fixed, not a journal recovery
issue.

i.e. I'd much prefer we have strict verification because that finds
logic bugs on both sides during testing, that way they do not end up
in production systems...

-Dave.
