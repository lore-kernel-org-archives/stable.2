I don't think the problem is the process itself... It's been pretty
time consuming to keep filtering the good patches from the bad ones,
and no matter what we do, people will always yell at us.
If we don't review patches, people will yell, if we do a non-thorough
review and miss something, people will yell. If we use assistants to
help on review and yet something slips, people will yell.
We've got a huge inflow of patches but from those patches I'd guess 5%
of the authors actually understand what the patch is doing, 1% actually
at least do some testing and 0.1% do any trustable review (and not just
look at Sashiko interface and RwB based on that), and... LLMs are
convincing enough that it gets really hard to catch issues and LLMs try
extremely hard to sell their fix which adds to the time toll.
