Which also observed by Mark and myself.

The splat it result of new check introduced by b5cc230af5e5 ("tracing:
Warn when an event dereferences a pointer in TP_printk()") which
correctly catches issue with %pad dereferencing the address saved in
the ring buffer. TP_fast_assign() logic gets executed when the
tracepoint is triggered, however the TP_printk() is executed when the
user reads the trace buffer which could be seconds, minutes, hours,
days, even months later and nothing guarantee that __entry->gpd_ring
pointer will still be pointing to what it was when it was recorded.

Fix the issue by capturing immediate value of gpd_ring.dma when trace
point is triggered.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit message forensics

**Step 1.1: Subject line**
Record: **[usb/mtu3]** **[Fix]** Double dereference in `TP_printk` for
the `mtu3_log_ep` trace class
(`mtu3_gadget_ep_enable/disable/set_halt`).

**Step 1.2: Tags**
Record:
- **Reported-by:** Paul E. McKenney
- **Tested-by:** Mark Rutland
- **Reviewed-by:** Steven Rostedt (tracing maintainer)
- **Signed-off-by:** Vladimir Murzin (author); Paul E. McKenney (merged
  via his tree)
- **No Fixes:** tag (expected for this review)
- **No Cc: stable** (expected)
- No syzbot, no CVE, no bugzilla Link
- Ignore pipeline “Upstream commit” / Sasha Levin SOB

Notable: three independent observers (Paul, Mark, the author). Rostedt
reviewed it.

**Step 1.3: Body**
Record:
- **Bug:** `TP_printk` uses `%pad` with `&REC->gpd_ring->dma`, i.e. it
  follows a pointer stored in the ring buffer when the trace is printed,
  not when it is recorded.
- **Symptom that motivated the patch:** boot `WARNING` in
  `test_double_dereference()` on 7.3.0-rc1 (`linux,dummy-virt`), events
  `mtu3_gadget_ep_set_halt/disable/enable`.
- **Root cause (author):** check added by `b5cc230af5e5` (“tracing: Warn
  when an event dereferences a pointer in TP_printk()”).
  `TP_fast_assign()` runs at the tracepoint; `TP_printk()` can run much
  later, when `__entry->gpd_ring` may be stale.
- **Fix:** snapshot `mep->gpd_ring.dma` into a `dma_addr_t` field at
  assign time and print `&__entry->gpd_ring_dma`.
- **Versions in the message:** 7.3.0-rc1 only. Mailing list later says
  the splat was still present in 7.3-rc5/rc6.

Linus’s merge of `8fc6e594884a` describes the same bug as pre-existing:
it can dump garbage traces because `TP_printk()` may run after the
pointed-to memory is gone. Extra tracing checks only **exposed** it.

**Step 1.4: Hidden bug fix?**
Record: Not hidden. It is an explicit tracing UAF/stale-pointer fix. The
boot WARN is how it was found; the real defect is delayed dereference of
a saved kernel pointer.

---

## Phase 2: Diff analysis

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
Record:
- File: `drivers/usb/mtu3/mtu3_trace.h` only (+3 / −1; 4-line class)
- Function/class: `DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS(mtu3_log_ep)` (shared by
  `mtu3_gadget_ep_enable`, `mtu3_gadget_ep_disable`,
  `mtu3_gadget_ep_set_halt`)
- Scope: single-file surgical tracing fix

**Step 2.2: Code flow**
Record: **Before:** `TP_fast_assign` stores `__entry->gpd_ring =
&mep->gpd_ring`. `TP_printk` prints `%p/%pad` with `__entry->gpd_ring,
&__entry->gpd_ring->dma`. **After:** also stores `__entry->gpd_ring_dma
= mep->gpd_ring.dma` and prints `&__entry->gpd_ring_dma`. Affected path
is trace **print**, not gadget I/O.

Verified in this tree’s `lib/vsprintf.c` `address_val()`: `%pad` does
`*(const dma_addr_t *)addr`. The old argument therefore both follows
`gpd_ring` and then dereferences `.dma`.

**Step 2.3: Bug mechanism**
Record: **Memory safety / delayed pointer dereference in tracing (UAF or
garbage).** `%p` of the saved pointer is safe; `%pad` is not. `gpd_ring`
is embedded in `struct mtu3_ep` (`mtu3.h`). `mtu3_gpd_ring_free()`
`memset`s the ring on disable; the `mtu3_ep` itself is freed on unbind.
Reading traces after unbind is a use-after-free. Reading after disable
but before unbind can print a later (zeroed) DMA address instead of the
recorded one.

**Step 2.4: Fix quality**
Record: Obviously correct and minimal. `%pad` still gets a `dma_addr_t
*`, now into the ring-buffer entry. The missing semicolon on the new
assign is harmless: `TP_fast_assign` is expanded with a trailing `;`. No
API/locking/hot-path change. Regression risk is very low. The leftover
`__field(struct mtu3_gpd_ring *, gpd_ring)` is still only printed with
`%p`.

---

## Phase 3: Git history

**Step 3.1: Blame**
Record: Buggy `mtu3_log_ep` pattern comes from `83374e035b628` (“usb:
mtu3: add tracepoints to help debug”, Chunfeng Yun, 2019-03-21). Present
in this tree (`git merge-base --is-ancestor 83374e035b628 HEAD`
succeeded). Long-lived, not recent code.

**Step 3.2: Fixes: tag**
Record: None on the merged commit. An earlier unused submission
(Shixiong Ou, 2026-08-28) tagged `Fixes: 83374e035b62`. That introducing
commit **is** in this tree.

**Step 3.3: File history**
Record (path-limited log):
- `83374e035b628` add tracepoints
- later style/`__vstring`/`__assign_str` churn
- this fix

Standalone; not patch X/Y. No prerequisite refactor in this file beyond
what 6.18 already has (`__assign_str(name)` without a second argument is
already here).

**Step 3.4: Author**
Record: Vladimir Murzin is not the mtu3 maintainer (that is Chunfeng
Yun, CC’d). He is an ARM engineer fixing a splat he, Paul, and Mark hit.
Rostedt reviewed. Paul merged it when USB maintainers were slow (splat
still in 7.3-rc6).

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
Record: None. Uses existing `dma_addr_t`, `TP_*`, and
`mep->gpd_ring.dma`. No new tracing helpers. `b5cc230af5e5` is the
detector, **not** a prerequisite for the fix.

---

## Phase 4: Mailing list / external

**Step 4.1: Original discussion**
Record:
- `b4 dig -c cfb3293c4573289f11f913611f530ea6b1926d67` → https://patch.m
  sgid.link/20260922103756.104846-1-vladimir.murzin@arm.com
- `b4 dig -a`: single revision (v1 only)
- Thread: ping for 7.3-rc5/rc6 splat; Paul offered to merge because the
  WARN broke his tests; later merged and Linus pulled it
- No NAK. No reviewer asked for `Cc: stable`
- lore.kernel.org fetch returned 403; thread recovered via `b4 dig -m`

**Step 4.2: Recipients (`b4 dig -w`)**
Record: linux-usb, linux-arm-kernel, linux-mediatek, linux-kernel,
Chunfeng Yun, Greg KH, Steven Rostedt, Paul McKenney, Mark Rutland.
Right lists and maintainers.

**Step 4.3: Bug report**
Record: Reproduced by Paul, Mark, and Vladimir on 7.3-rc1+ (dummy-virt).
Independent earlier patch from Shixiong Ou describes the same WARN and
the same stale-pointer/UAF. Severity for **those** kernels is a boot
WARN whenever `CONFIG_USB_MTU3` is built. That WARN is **not** in
6.18.y.

**Step 4.4: Series**
Record: Standalone. Duplicate independently submitted by Shixiong Ou
(same approach, field named `gpd_dma`). Murzin’s version is what merged.

**Step 4.5: Stable list**
Record: No useful hit on lore stable for this subject. Not a documented
“do not backport.”

---

## Phase 5: Semantic / call graph

**Step 5.1: Functions**
Record: `mtu3_log_ep` class; events `mtu3_gadget_ep_enable`,
`mtu3_gadget_ep_disable`, `mtu3_gadget_ep_set_halt`.

**Step 5.2: Callers**
Record (this tree):
- `mtu3_gadget_ep_enable()` — `drivers/usb/mtu3/mtu3_gadget.c:202`
- `mtu3_gadget_ep_disable()` — line 214 (before `mtu3_ep_disable()` /
  `mtu3_gpd_ring_free()`)
- `mtu3_gadget_ep_set_halt()` — line 404

These are USB gadget ep ops: enable/disable/halt from gadget drivers /
configfs. Common on MediaTek gadget/OTG, not a syscall of its own.

**Step 5.3: Callees**
Record: TRACE_EVENT assign/print only. No alloc/lock/I/O in the changed
code. `%pad` → `address_val()` → dereference `dma_addr_t *`.

**Step 5.4: Reachability**
Record: Recording: gadget ep enable/disable/halt with these events on.
Printing: reading the trace buffer. UAF: print after `mtu3_ep` is freed
(driver unbind). Boot WARN: only if `test_double_dereference()` exists
(it does not here). Unprivileged users normally cannot enable tracefs.

**Step 5.5: Similar patterns**
Record: Other mtu3 events print saved pointers with `%p` only (safe).
Same class already in this 6.18.y tree: `0b0d2f9db2406` (“eth: ice:
don't dereference pointers from TP_printk()”), also written against
`b5cc230af5e5`, and it **is** an ancestor of `v6.18.57`.

---

## Phase 6: This checkout only

**Step 6.1: Does the buggy code exist?**
Record: **Yes, in v6.18.57.** `git describe HEAD` →
`v6.18.57-155-gcdf239ca885b2`; `make kernelversion` → **6.18.57**.
v6.18.57 `mtu3_trace.h` still has `__entry->gpd_ring,
&__entry->gpd_ring->dma`. Introduced 2019. `git merge-base --is-ancestor
dff6c93cf7131 v6.18.57` failed (fix not in 6.18.57).
`test_double_dereference` is **absent** from `kernel/trace/`
(`b5cc230af5e5` is not an ancestor of HEAD).

**Step 6.2: Backport difficulty**
Record: **Clean apply.** `git diff v6.18.57 dff6c93cf7131 --
drivers/usb/mtu3/mtu3_trace.h` is exactly this 4-line change. Context
matches 6.18 (`__assign_str(name)` already present).

**Step 6.3: Related fix already here?**
Record: No other mtu3 `TP_printk` fix in `v6.18..v6.18.57`. The ice
analogue **is** already in 6.18.57. That does not replace this mtu3 bug.

---

## Phase 7: Subsystem context

**Step 7.1**
Record: **drivers/usb/mtu3** — MediaTek USB3 dual-role. Criticality:
**PERIPHERAL/IMPORTANT for MTK** (`CONFIG_USB_MTU3`, `depends on
ARCH_MEDIATEK || COMPILE_TEST`). Tracepoints compiled with the driver
when `CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS` is on.

**Step 7.2**
Record: Mature driver (tracepoints since 2019). Recent 6.18.y mtu3 fixes
include DMA unmap on queue failure and suspend-with-gadget. Not staging.

---

## Phase 8: Impact and risk

**Step 8.1: Who is affected**
Record: MediaTek USB3 gadget users who enable these ftrace events and
later print the buffer. Distro kernels that build mtu3 for
`COMPILE_TEST` do **not** get the 7.3 boot WARN here, because that check
is missing.

**Step 8.2: Trigger**
Record: Not every boot on 6.18.y. Needs `CONFIG_USB_MTU3` + tracepoints
+ enable these events + later print. UAF additionally needs the
endpoint/device object to have been freed. Not unprivileged. The 7.3
boot WARN fires even on dummy-virt; **that path does not exist in this
tree**.

**Step 8.3: Failure mode**
Record:
- On 7.3+: boot `WARNING` — **does not apply to 6.18.57**
- On this tree: delayed deref → **garbage DMA address in traces**, or
  **UAF/oops** if `mtu3_ep` was freed — severity **HIGH** when hit,
  **MEDIUM** overall because the trigger is a debug path

**Step 8.4: Risk vs benefit**
Record: **Benefit:** closes a real stale-pointer/UAF in mtu3 gadget
traces; same class already taken for ice on this series. **Risk:** very
low (3 insertions, print-time only). Ratio favors backport.

---

## Phase 9: Synthesis

**Step 9.1: Evidence**

For:
- Real delayed dereference of a kernel pointer from the trace buffer
  (`%pad` confirmed to dereference)
- Buggy code present in this 6.18.y tree since 2019
- Small, obviously correct, applies cleanly
- Reviewed by Rostedt; reported/tested by McKenney and Rutland
- Same class (`TP_printk` must not follow saved pointers) already in
  v6.18.57 for ice
- No new API/feature; no series dependency

Against:
- The boot splat that drove the patch **cannot happen here**
  (`test_double_dereference` / `b5cc230af5e5` not in 6.18.y)
- Debug/tracing path, MediaTek-specific, needs events enabled
- Failure is often wrong trace text rather than a production USB failure
- No `Cc: stable` in review (not a negative per the rules)

Unresolved: lore.kernel.org HTTP 403 (thread read from `b4` mbox
instead).

**Step 9.2: Stable rules**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** (Rostedt Reviewed-by, Mark
   Tested-by, logic is local)
2. Real bug that affects users? **PASS** (stale pointer / UAF when
   traces are printed)
3. Important (crash/security/corruption/deadlock)? **PASS** (UAF/oops
   possible on print after free; garbage traces otherwise). The 7.3 boot
   WARN is not the important part **for this tree**.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** (one header, 4 lines)
5. No new features/APIs? **PASS**
6. Can apply to this tree? **PASS** (clean vs v6.18.57)

**Step 9.3: Exception category**
Record: None (not a device ID/quirk/DT/build/docs exception). It is a
normal small bugfix.

**Step 9.4: Decision**
The 7.3 boot WARN is not a reason to take this on 6.18.y. The reason to
take it is the pre-existing `TP_printk` dereference, which **is** in
this tree, is a real UAF/garbage-print bug, is a 4-line no-brainer, and
matches a fix this series already accepted for ice.

## What this means for 6.18.y users

`mtu3_log_ep` stores `&mep->gpd_ring` and later does `%pad` on
`&gpd_ring->dma`. Print can happen long after disable/unbind. That is a
real bug in this tree. The patch only snapshots `gpd_ring.dma` at event
time. It does not change gadget behavior.

## Verification

- **[Phase 1]** Parsed tags: Reported-by Paul McKenney, Tested-by Mark
  Rutland, Reviewed-by Steven Rostedt; no Fixes/Cc-stable
- **[Phase 2]** Diff: +`gpd_ring_dma` field, assign `mep->gpd_ring.dma`,
  print `&__entry->gpd_ring_dma`
- **[Phase 2]** `%pad` in `lib/vsprintf.c` `address_val()`: `num =
  *(const dma_addr_t *)addr`
- **[Phase 2]** `struct mtu3_ep` has embedded `struct mtu3_gpd_ring
  gpd_ring`; `mtu3_gpd_ring_free()` memsets it
- **[Phase 3]** Blame: `83374e035b628` (2019) introduced the pattern;
  ancestor of HEAD
- **[Phase 3]** `git merge-base --is-ancestor b5cc230af5e5 HEAD` failed;
  no `test_double_dereference` in this tree
- **[Phase 3]** Author log on `drivers/usb/`: this commit plus unrelated
  xhci work
- **[Phase 4]** `b4 dig -c cfb3293c4573`: msgid
  `20260922103756.104846-1-vladimir.murzin@arm.com`; v1 only
- **[Phase 4]** `b4 dig -w`: USB/Mediatek lists, Greg KH, Chunfeng Yun,
  Rostedt
- **[Phase 4]** mbox: Paul merged after 7.3-rc5/rc6 pings; no NAK; no
  stable nomination
- **[Phase 4]** UNVERIFIED: live lore.kernel.org page (403)
- **[Phase 5]** Callers: `mtu3_gadget_ep_enable/disable/set_halt` in
  `mtu3_gadget.c`
- **[Phase 6]** `git describe HEAD` = v6.18.57-155-gcdf239ca885b2;
  kernelversion 6.18.57
- **[Phase 6]** v6.18.57 still has `&__entry->gpd_ring->dma`; fix not an
  ancestor of v6.18.57
- **[Phase 6]** File diff vs v6.18.57 is exactly this patch (clean)
- **[Phase 6]** ice TP_printk analogue `0b0d2f9db2406` **is** in
  v6.18.57
- **[Phase 8]** Boot WARN not reachable here; UAF/garbage on delayed
  print is

The fix is small, correct, already matches this tree’s context, and
closes a real tracing UAF, not a 7.3-only WARN.

**YES**
