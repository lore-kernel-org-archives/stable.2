7.3-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 1acb4fd2d011c4bd6cc961095ae17361c71ff61a ]

The comment in fsverity_ioctl_read_metadata(), which justifies not
checking for FMODE_READ, doesn't consider that the nonstandard access
mode 3 (ioctl-only) exists.

Opening an ioctl-only fd generally requires read (and write) permission.
However, there are gaps with certain LSMs: an ioctl-only fd requests
read (and write) permission via security_inode_permission, but not
security_file_open.  With certain LSMs relying on the latter, such as
Landlock and AppArmor, an ioctl-only fd can be opened without the LSM
granting read (and write) permission.

Since FS_IOC_READ_VERITY_METADATA returns hashes of file contents
blocks, it should require read permission.  This also applies to
FS_IOC_MEASURE_VERITY, which returns a hash for the whole file.

Meanwhile, ioctl-only fds are a rarely-used feature, not known to be
used with either ioctl.

Therefore, just disallow these ioctls on ioctl-only file descriptors,
similar to what was already done with FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY.

More specifically, explicitly check for FMODE_READ.  This also covers
write-only fds to non-verity files which otherwise would have failed
with ENODATA.  This change in error code for write-only fds should be
fine too, as these ioctls cannot be usefully used with write-only fds
anyway, but it's worth noting as another technicality.

Fixes: 4dd893d832cf ("fs-verity: implement FS_IOC_MEASURE_VERITY ioctl")
Fixes: e17fe6579de0 ("fs-verity: add FS_IOC_READ_VERITY_METADATA ioctl")
