With Rx hardware timestamping enabled (e.g. by ptp4l), igb strips the
16-byte inline timestamp header from every Rx buffer of a frame instead
of only from the first one. A continuation buffer that starts with 8
zero bytes loses 16 bytes, so jumbo frames with zero payload arrive
short and are dropped.

v3 used skb == NULL to find the first buffer of a frame. The Sashiko
AI review pointed out that this does not hold when an XDP program
consumes the first buffer of a frame that spans several buffers, so v3
was sent back for rework.

The same question came up for igc. There, Maciej suggested not to track
frame boundaries in the data path, but to make sure that frames never
span several buffers while XDP is attached [1]. Paul Moses' igc v3 does
that [2]. This version follows the same approach for igb:

  1/3 limits the receive length (RLPML, or the PF pool's VMOLR with VFs)
      to the configured frame size while XDP is attached, and leaves
      room for the timestamp header in the XDP buffer size checks for
      3 KiB, legacy-rx and PAGE_SIZE >= 8192 buffers. It also refuses
      XDP with rx-all and legacy-rx changes while XDP is attached, as
      both would break the limit. The limit is now set from
      igb_configure() instead of igb_set_rx_mode(). With VFs, the PF
      pool limit is also written on i354.
  2/3 is v3, unchanged in code, with a note that it relies on 1/3.
      The Reviewed-by and Tested-by tags of v3 are kept for that reason.
  3/3 gives AF_XDP zero-copy rings a 2 KiB or 3 KiB hardware buffer
      instead of rounding the XSK frame size down to 1 KiB. It refuses
      XSK pools that cannot hold the current maximum frame plus the
      timestamp header, and MTU changes that would no longer fit a bound
      pool. Unlike the igc patch in [2], which checks against the
      largest XDP MTU, this checks the current MTU, as igb allows XDP up
      to MTU 3030 and a fixed check would rule out 2 KiB chunks.
      Enabling VFs, which takes queues from the PF, is refused with
      -EBUSY while an XSK pool is bound to a queue the PF would lose; the
      core refuses ethtool -L in the same case. A pool on a queue hidden
      in another way, for example after a fallback to MSI, is checked
      again when its ring is set up.

As in igc, 1/3 moves the RLPML programming out of igb_set_rx_mode(),
which can run without RTNL, into igb_configure(), which runs when the
interface is (re)configured, before Rx is enabled. This includes the PF
pool limit in VMOLR, which igb_set_rx_mode() now leaves as it is.
Attaching or removing XDP on a running interface goes through
igb_close() and igb_open(), and an MTU change through igb_down() and
igb_up(), so the limit is updated before Rx is enabled again.

The Sashiko reviews of v4 and v5 also point out three older issues
that this series does not change:

- On 2 KiB build_skb rings, igb_skb_pad() leaves exactly
  IGB_MAX_FRAME_BUILD_SKB bytes before skb_shared_info, with no room for
  the 16-byte timestamp header. With Rx timestamping on, frame and
  header can overlap skb_shared_info by up to 12 bytes, or 2 bytes at
  the XDP limit at MTU 1500. This dates from 9cbc948b5a20 ("igb: add XDP
  support"). I left it out of this series: it is a separate problem from
  the one fixed here, and a fix changes the buffer layout and the XDP
  headroom for all igb users, so it needs its own review and testing.
- igb_set_vf_rlpml() let a VF set other VMOLR bits of its own pool. That
  is fixed separately: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20261104-igb-vf-rlpml-v1-1-729621b60eee@aweta.nl/
- igb_alloc_rx_buffers_zc() does not clear the length of the next
  descriptor after a partial refill at the end of the ring, so
  igb_clean_rx_irq_zc() can read a stale descriptor. igc clears it in
  that case. This is a separate zero-copy problem as well.

How to reproduce
----------------
Receiver with igb (eth0), peer with MTU 8228. hwstamp_ctl turns on Rx
timestamping with filter ALL, no ptp4l needed; this ping method is
taken from Paul's igc report. One host with two ports also works if
the sending port is moved into its own network namespace.

1) Truncated jumbo frames (patch 2)

  receiver:  ip link set eth0 mtu 8228
             hwstamp_ctl -i eth0 -r 1
  peer:      ping -c 5 -M do -s 8200 -p 00 <receiver>

  Without the series there are no replies, and IpExtInTruncatedPkts
  goes up by one per frame. With the series all requests are answered.

2) XDP consumes the first buffer (patch 1)

  receiver:  ip link set eth0 mtu 3000
             hwstamp_ctl -i eth0 -r 1
             xdp-filter load -m native eth0
             xdp-filter ip <peer> -m src
             tcpdump -nn -e -i eth0 'ether src 00:00:00:00:00:00'
  peer:      ping -c 3 -M do -s 8200 -p 00 <receiver>

  At MTU 3000 XDP can attach, but without patch 1 the MAC still accepts
  the 8242-byte frames, which then span three Rx buffers. xdp-filter
  drops the first one, and the rest reaches the stack as a separate
  frame with all-zero MAC addresses:

    without the series    5154 bytes (header stripped twice)
    v3 alone              5170 bytes (stripped once)
    this series           no frame; rx_long_length_errors +1 per frame

3) AF_XDP zero-copy with 2 KiB chunks (patch 3)

  receiver:  ip link set eth0 mtu 1500
             ethtool -L eth0 combined 1
             hwstamp_ctl -i eth0 -r 1
             xdpsock -i eth0 -q 0 -r -z -N -f 2048
  peer:      ping -c 50 -i 0.02 -s 1472 <receiver>

  xdpsock is from xdp-project/bpf-examples (AF_XDP-example). It also
  takes ARP, so the peer needs a fresh ARP entry before it starts.
  Compare rx_packets (MAC) with rx_queue_0_packets in ethtool -S:

    without the series    68 frames, 118 descriptors
    this series           64 frames, 64 descriptors

  At MTU 3000, -f 4096 receives 3014-byte frames in one buffer. Binding
  with -f 2048 at MTU 3000 was refused with EOPNOTSUPP by the new check
  on the 6.14.9 test kernel; current kernels refuse it earlier, in
  xp_assign_dev(), with EINVAL.

Tested on an I350 with these patches applied to the igb driver of
kernel 6.14.9 (the series itself is against v7.1-rc7), with the steps
above: results as listed. The v3 line is from an earlier run with an
XDP program dropping ICMP. Also checked: XDP attach at MTU 1500 and
3030 works, at MTU 3046 it is refused, as is an MTU change to 3046
with XDP attached. With two VFs allocated (booted with pci=realloc),
step 2 gives the same picture: three leftover frames without the
series, none with it, as the PF pool limit in VMOLR drops the frames.
In step 3, 98-byte frames and 4 KiB chunks take one descriptor per
frame with and without the series. With XDP attached, rx-all stays off
and legacy-rx cannot be changed, and XDP attach is refused with rx-all
on, or with legacy-rx on at MTU 3000, also when it was set while the
interface was down. RLPML and the PF pool's VMOLR limit read back as
expected with and without XDP and VFs. In repeated runs of about 200 MTU
changes each with XDP and two VFs, the limit was right after every
change, except for one read in one run, where the value was not logged;
eight reruns showed no mismatch.

The steps above were repeated on kernel 7.3.1 with the series applied
to the v7.3 igb driver, with the same results, including step 2 with
VFs. There, enabling two VFs while xdpsock was bound to queue 1 was
refused with EBUSY; with the socket on queue 0 it worked. With the
driver built so that the I350 keeps two Rx queues with VFs, as an 82576
does, the VF enable with the socket on queue 1 was refused as well. The
i354 path was checked with the driver built so that the I350 takes the
i354 branches for VMOLR: with two VFs and XDP attached, the PF pool
limit kept its old value of 9728 with v5, which skipped i354, and read
back as 3026 at MTU 3000 and 1526 at MTU 1500 with v6. Only the
registers were checked; I have no i354 to test on.
Not tested: PAGE_SIZE >= 8192.

The patches, their descriptions and this cover letter were prepared
with the help of an AI coding assistant (Claude). I reviewed them and
ran the tests above on my test bench.

[2] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20261028083344.3047350-1-p@1g4.org/

Changes in v6:
- Patch 1: with VFs, also write the PF pool limit on i354 (Sashiko).
- Patch 3: refuse to enable VFs with -EBUSY while an XSK pool is bound
  to a queue the PF would lose (Maciej). Restore the DMA coalescing flag
  on that error. Keep the frame size check in igb_xsk_pool() only for
  queues hidden in another way, such as a fallback to MSI.
- Patch 4 dropped: with patch 3 the hardware does not split frames in
  zero-copy mode, so it only added dead code to the hot path (Maciej).
- Link to v5: https://patch.msgid.link/20261104-igb-rx-ts-fix-v5-0-bf4b4367129a@aweta.nl

Changes in v5:
- Patch 1: v4 also subtracted the timestamp header from the build_skb
  frame limit, so XDP no longer attached at MTU 1495-1510 on x86
  (1493-1508 where NET_IP_ALIGN is 2), including the default MTU 1500.
  Only subtract the header where the limit is the hardware buffer size,
  and compute it from the adapter state instead of the ring flags. Skip
  the check when XDP is removed, so a program can always be detached.
- Patch 1: refuse XDP with rx-all and legacy-rx changes with XDP
  attached, and turn rx-all back on after XDP removal if it was
  requested meanwhile. Program RLPML and the PF pool limit from
  igb_configure() instead of igb_set_rx_mode(). With XDP attached, an
  MTU change can now move from 2 KiB to 3 KiB buffers. Added
  Suggested-by: Maciej.
- Patch 1: the issues above were also reported by the Sashiko review
  of v4.
- Patch 2: no code change. Commit message: igc is fixed by Paul's
  series, not by this patch; the loss is per continuation buffer, not
  only at the tail; the possible size wrap is described (Sashiko).
- New patch 3: AF_XDP zero-copy Rx buffer size, as asked by Maciej.
- New patch 4: drop zero-copy frames that span several descriptors;
  depends on patch 3.
- Link to v4: https://patch.msgid.link/20261102-igb-rx-ts-fix-v4-0-8785124c5d23@aweta.nl

Changes in v4:
- New patch 1: limit the receive length while XDP is attached, so that
  skb == NULL reliably marks the first buffer (Sashiko review), as
  done for igc.
- Patch 2: no code change; added a note that it relies on patch 1.
- Link to v3: https://patch.msgid.link/20260625-igb-rx-ts-fix-v3-1-99b3efa08dca@aweta.nl
