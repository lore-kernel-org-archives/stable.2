do_withdraw() sets SB_RDONLY from the withdraw work item without holding
sb->s_umount. gfs2_withdraw() sets SDF_WITHDRAWN right away and queues
gfs2_withdraw_func() which runs do_withdraw(). That also happens on a
frozen filesystem. SDF_JOURNAL_LIVE is still set then because the
freeze log flush doesn't clear it.

freeze_super() and thaw_super() both look at sb_rdonly() to figure out
whether the s_writers rwsems need to be taken or released. gfs2 doesn't
even get that far. FITHAW goes through gfs2_thaw_super() to
gfs2_do_thaw() whose gfs2_freeze_lock_shared() fails with -EIO for a
withdrawn filesystem. So FITHAW never gets to thaw_super() and the
filesystem stays frozen. The only ways out are emergency thaw, which
calls thaw_super_locked() directly, and writing 0 to the gfs2 "freeze"
sysfs file, which calls thaw_super() directly. Both see SB_RDONLY and
skip sb_freeze_unlock(). The rwsems stay write-locked, writes through
file descriptors opened before the withdraw hang and umount warns:

  gfs2: fsid=s2test:s2fs.0: can't lock the freeze glock: -5
  gfs2: fsid=s2test:s2fs.0: GFS2: couldn't thaw filesystem: -5
  sysrq: Emergency Thaw of all frozen filesystems
  WARNING: kernel/rcu/sync.c:177 at rcu_sync_dtor+0x143/0x190

  [<0>] percpu_rwsem_wait+0x203/0x500
  [<0>] vfs_write+0xb57/0xfa0

Withdrawing first and freezing afterwards isn't any better.
freeze_super() freezes the read-only superblock without the rwsems,
gfs2_lock_fs_check_clean() fails with -EIO and gfs2_do_thaw() can't get
the freeze glock. FIFREEZE fails with -EIO and the superblock stays
frozen and pinned for good.

SDF_WITHDRAWN already stops all modifications. Glocks fail with -EIO,
gfs2_trans_begin() with -EROFS and log flushes and metadata reads are
refused. So stop setting SB_RDONLY in do_withdraw() like ext4 did in
commit d3476f3dad4a ("ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem
errors"). A few things have to come with that:

(1) gfs2_evict_inode() and gfs2_quota_sync() check gfs2_withdrawn() next
    to sb_rdonly(). Eviction writes the inode glock's metadata in place
    and umount evicts everything.

(2) gfs2_write_inode() returns -EIO once withdrawn. sync(2), syncfs(2),
    freeze and umount skipped writeback for the read-only superblock.
    Now they reach ->write_inode() which writes the glock address space
    in place without a withdrawn check, and gfs2_ail_drain() leaves
    committed buffers dirty. Data writeback needs no check because the
    block mapping goes through gfs2_meta_read() which fails once
    withdrawn.

(3) gfs2_do_thaw() thaws even if the freeze glock can't be taken again
    because the filesystem withdrew. A withdrawn filesystem can't write
    anything and its lockspace is gone anyway.

(4) gfs2_freeze_super() refuses a withdrawn filesystem with -EIO before
    calling freeze_super(). It can't take the freeze glock anymore and
    freeze_super() would now take the rwsems of the read-write
    superblock before gfs2_lock_fs_check_clean() fails.

Note that the SB_RDONLY change and (3) have to go in together and the
rest has to be in place by then. With only the SB_RDONLY change a freeze
after a withdraw takes the rwsems of the now read-write superblock and
stays frozen for good with writers blocked. With only (3) FITHAW reaches
thaw_super() on the read-only superblock and leaks the rwsems. And
without (4) a freeze after a withdraw goes through the error path of
gfs2_freeze_super() which re-locks sd_freeze_gh while
gfs2_lock_fs_check_clean() still holds it. The umount that is now
possible then hangs in gfs2_wait_glocks().

While withdrawn a remount to read-write fails with -EROFS instead of the
-EIO from gfs2_make_fs_rw(). A remount to read-only goes through
gfs2_make_fs_ro() which writes nothing once do_withdraw() has run, and
since the previous patch gfs2_make_fs_ro() waits for that. So emergency
remount (sysrq u), which now forces every withdrawn gfs2 read-only,
works without a WARN.

We show "withdrawn" in the mount options next to the existing
"demote_interface_used". A withdrawn filesystem stays "rw" so statfs()
doesn't report ST_RDONLY anymore, and the "Mounted RO" line in the sysfs
status file and the RDONLY= uevent field read 0 too. A second mount of
the device and a gfs2meta mount have to be read-write now. And like with
"emergency_ro" on ext4, remount helpers that pass the shown options back
fail. busybox mount for example now gets "Unknown parameter
'withdrawn'".

Path based operations fail with -EIO as before. The mount root is the
exception because it isn't looked up. So operations on it now fail with
-EIO from the glocks instead of -EROFS from mnt_want_write(), and the
same goes for fd based chmod, chown, utimes, setxattr and fileattr
changes. syncfs(2) on a withdrawn filesystem returns gfs2_sync_fs()'s
sd_log_error, e.g. -EIO, instead of 0. FITHAW of a filesystem that
withdrew while frozen works now and FIFREEZE of a withdrawn filesystem
fails with -EIO without freezing it.

Reproducer (the sb_rdonly selftest at the end of this series covers it
as well):

  mkfs.gfs2 -O -p lock_nolock -j 1 -t test:fs img; mount -o loop img /mnt
  exec 3>>/mnt/a 4</mnt          # paths stop working after the withdraw
  fsfreeze -f /mnt
  echo 1 > /sys/fs/gfs2/test:fs/withdraw; sleep 8
  <FITHAW on fd 4>               # before: EIO, stays frozen; after: thawed
  echo j > /proc/sysrq-trigger   # before: the only way out, leaks the rwsems
  echo x >&3                     # before: hangs in percpu_rwsem_wait(); after: EIO
  umount /mnt                    # before: WARNING at rcu_sync_dtor()
