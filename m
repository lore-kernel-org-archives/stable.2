[ Upstream commit 690e47d1403e90b7f2366f03b52ed3304194c793 ]

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

Above are some of the common examples of the crashes that were observed
due to this issue.

Details
=======
Let's look at the following scenario to understand this race.

1) CPU A enters push_rt_task
  a) CPU A has chosen next_task = task p.
  b) CPU A calls find_lock_lowest_rq(Task p, CPU Z’s rq).
  c) CPU A identifies CPU X as a destination CPU (X < Z).
  d) CPU A enters double_lock_balance(CPU Z’s rq, CPU X’s rq).
  e) Since X is lower than Z, CPU A unlocks CPU Z’s rq. Someone else has
     locked CPU X’s rq, and thus, CPU A must wait.

2) At CPU Z
  a) Previous task has completed execution and thus, CPU Z enters
     schedule, locks its own rq after CPU A releases it.
  b) CPU Z dequeues previous task and begins executing task p.
  c) CPU Z unlocks its rq.
  d) Task p yields the CPU (ex. by doing IO or waiting to acquire a
     lock) which triggers the schedule function on CPU Z.
  e) CPU Z enters schedule again, locks its own rq, and dequeues task p.
  f) As part of dequeue, it sets p.on_rq = 0 and unlocks its rq.

3) At CPU B
  a) CPU B enters try_to_wake_up with input task p.
  b) Since CPU Z dequeued task p, p.on_rq = 0, and CPU B updates
     B.state = WAKING.
  c) CPU B via select_task_rq determines CPU Y as the target CPU.

4) The race
  a) CPU A acquires CPU X’s lock and relocks CPU Z.
  b) CPU A reads task p.cpu = Z and incorrectly concludes task p is
     still on CPU Z.
  c) CPU A failed to notice task p had been dequeued from CPU Z while
     CPU A was waiting for locks in double_lock_balance. If CPU A knew
     that task p had been dequeued, it would return NULL forcing
     push_rt_task to give up the task p's migration.
  d) CPU B updates task p.cpu = Y and calls ttwu_queue.
  e) CPU B locks Ys rq. CPU B enqueues task p onto Y and sets task
     p.on_rq = 1.
  f) CPU B unlocks CPU Y, triggering memory synchronization.
  g) CPU A reads task p.on_rq = 1, cementing its assumption that task p
     has not migrated.
  h) CPU A decides to migrate p to CPU X.

This leads to A dequeuing p from Y's queue and various crashes down the
line.

Solution
========
The solution here is fairly simple. After obtaining the lock (at 4a),
the check is enhanced to make sure that the task is still at the head of
the pushable tasks list. If not, then it is anyway not suitable for
being pushed out.

Testing
=======
The fix is tested on a cluster of 3 nodes, where the panics due to this
are hit every couple of days. A fix similar to this was deployed on such
cluster and was stable for more than 30 days.
